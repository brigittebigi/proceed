### How to use Proceed?

There are two main ways to use Proceed:

1. The Graphical User Interface (GUI), to use Proceed as user-friendly 
as possible:

    * double-click on the `proceed.bat` file, under Windows;
    * double-click on the `proceed.command` file, under MacOS or Linux.

2. The Command-line User Interface (CLI), with a set of programs, each 
one essentially independent of the others, that can be run on its own 
at the level of the shell.
