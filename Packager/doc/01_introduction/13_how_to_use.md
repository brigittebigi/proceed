### How to use PROCEED?

There are two main ways to use SPPAS:

1. The Graphical User Interface (GUI), to use PROCEED as user-friendly as possible:

    * double-click on the `proceed.bat` file, under Windows;
    * double-click on the `proceed.command` file, under MacOS or Linux.

2. The Command-line User Interface (CLI), with a set of programs, each one 
essentially independent of the others, that can be run on its own at the level 
of the shell.
