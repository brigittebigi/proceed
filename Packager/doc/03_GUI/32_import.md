* Step 3 : here come the moment where you have to be patient if you have a heavy document, for exemple it takes about 10 minutes for 220 submissions.

>If you are in this case, the software could stop (particularly under Windows), just close it et open it again, redo step 1 and 2 and let it works without using the computer.

* Step 4 : when the loading is completed, you have to choose where do you want to save the import. You can also choose if you want to save the document which were accepted or not and what do you want, the CSV and/or HTML file with your documents.
