## Main frame of Proceed


A Graphical User Interface is available to manage the data and export
the conference proceedings and/or book of abstracts. 

The GUI consists in managing the following data: 
Conferences, Authors, Documents and Sessions. 
Such data will then be used to generate the conference program, and the 
proceedings.

[SCREENSHOT]


The GUI is made of a menu and 3 main areas:

- a toolbar (top);
- a notebook (left);
- a data panel (right).


### Menu

It contains all functions that are available in the toolbar (see next 
section) and an advanced Help menu.

- save data: save CSV files of the loaded data;
- check data: diagnosis to know if loaded data can be exported as PDF;
- export data: export loaded data as a PDF document;

### Notebook

The notebook contains 3 pages with:

- the list of documents;

- the list of authors.

Clicking on one entry in the list allows to select it and print related information
in the data panel. Then, three actions can be performed on such data:

1. Add a new one.
2. Modify the selected one.
3. Delete the selected one.


### Data panel

This is an area to show the content of an entry. Nothing else!
