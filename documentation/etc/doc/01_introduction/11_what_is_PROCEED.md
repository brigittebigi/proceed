## What is Proceed?


### Main features

Proceed is a computer software package written and maintained
by Brigitte Bigi of the Laboratoire Parole et Langage, in Aix-en-Provence,
France.
Available for free, with open source code, there is simply no other package
to export automatically proceedings and book of abstracts:
Proceed is developed to allow the almost automatic generation of proceedings 
and book of abstracts. 

>This documentation will assume that you are using a relatively recent
>version of Proceed (last version available), and there's no reason not 
>to download the latest version whenever released.
