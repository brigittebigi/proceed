<p>The investigation on which this paper focuses is part of a large-scale longitudinal project, undertaken in Switzerland between 2009 and 2015, which investigates unexplored issues regarding the effects of starting age in relation to the learning of English which emerge in the course of secondary school. The study represents the first of its kind in Switzerland. It provides further evidence for the position that, in contradistinction to the general pattern in naturalistic settings, late classroom beginners are as successful as early classroom beginners, and in a shorter period. This research will be reported in full in a volume to be published in 2016 (Pfenninger & Singleton, in preparation a).</p> <p>In the current paper, we home in on the interaction of starting age for English with the role of knowledge of other languages (notably French) in an array of productive and receptive (oral and written) performance. In particular we give an account of our establishment of differential cross-linguistic influence (CLI) in areas where CLI effects have previously been claimed not to occur, or to be relatively rare, such as in respect of inflectional morphology. We also explore the differential influence of experience of additional languages on different skill areas. In addition we examine the impact of the learning order of languages on CLI.</p> <p>Using longitudinal data from the same student cohort (200 learners) over a period of five years has made it possible to examine in real time and in a thorough and detailed manner (cf. Pfenninger & Singleton, in preparation b) the relationships among (1) onset variables, (2) different types of evidence that are critical to investigations of cross-linguistic influence and (3) ultimate school achievement at the end of the period of normal schooling.</p> <p>Our results indicate that CLI is related to task effects and the learning order of languages rather than target language proficiency: with proficiency controlled for, L4 English was influenced by L3 French (in the late English starter data) more than L3 English was influenced by L4 French (in the early English starter data), both in terms of code-switching/mixing and grammatical morpheme transfer. However, these differences disappeared with time. For both starting age groups, we found overt inflectional morphology being transferred more often from L3 French to L4 English than from L1 Swiss German to L4 English.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>References:</p> <p> </p> <p>Pfenninger, S.

<p>On ne sait pas dans quelle mesure les préférences d'interprétation dans la L1 influencent l'interprétation d'un pronom anaphorique dans une L2. Roberts et al. (2008) ont observé une influence de la L1 dans une tâche off-line : les préférences d'interprétation d'apprenants du néerlandais étaient différentes suivant qu'ils étaient natifs du turc ou de l'allemand. En revanche, dans une tâche on-line d'enregistrement des mouvements oculaires en lecture, les deux groupes d'apprenants ne révélaient pas de préférences d'interprétation claires.</p> <p>Notre étude vise à étudier l'influence de la L1 dans l'interprétation d'un pronom anaphorique par des natifs francophones et hispanophones apprenants de l'allemand, dans une tâche off-line (questionnaires écrits) et une tâche on-line (paradigme du monde visuel). Dans des langues non-pro-drop comme le français et l'allemand, un pronom personnel clitique sujet est préférentiellement interprété comme se référant à un antécédent sujet (e.g., Bouma & Hopp, 2007). Dans une langue pro-drop comme l'espagnol, un pronom sujet réalisé est préférentiellement interprété comme se référant à un antécédent objet alors qu'un pronom nul est préférentiellement interprété comme se référant à un antécédent sujet (Alonso-Ovalle et al., 2002). Malgré la similarité du système pronominal, on observe dans des phrases telles que (1), des préférences d'interprétation du pronom anaphorique ambigu différentes en allemand et en français. Les locuteurs natifs de l'allemand interprètent préférentiellement le pronom « er » comme se référant au sujet de la proposition principale, alors que les locuteurs natifs du français interprètent préférentiellement le pronom « il » comme se référant à l'objet (Hemforth et al., 2010). Suivant Hemforth et al. (2010), la préférence pour l'objet observée en français est due à la possibilité d'utiliser une forme alternative non ambiguë pour exprimer la référence au sujet (... avant de rentrer à la maison).</p> <p>(1) Der Postbote hat den Straßenfeger getroffen, bevor <strong>er</strong> nach Hause ging./ Le facteur a rencontré le balayeur avant qu'<strong>il</strong> rentre à la maison.</p> <p>Deux groupes d'apprenants (22 natifs francophones et 23 natifs hispanophones) ont été testés. Leur niveau en allemand (B2 ou C1), ainsi que leur capacité en mémoire de travail (testée en L1 et L2), étaient équivalents.</p> <p>Les résultats montrent des différences claires dans les préférences d'interprétation des deux groupes. Les natifs francophones interprètent préférentiellement le pronom comme se référant au sujet dans les deux tâches (off-line et on-line) ; alors que les natifs hispanophones ne révèlent pas de préférence claire on-line mais une préférence pour le sujet off-line. Cette préférence pour le sujet reste néanmoins moins marquée que pour les francophones.</p> <p>Nos résultats révèlent 1) que la préférence pour le sujet observée en allemand est plus facile à acquérir pour des locuteurs natifs d'une autre langue non-pro-drop et 2) que le transfert ne se fait pas au niveau d'une construction spécifique. Enfin, nous argumenterons que les différences entre nos résultats et ceux de Roberts et al. (2008) sont dues à la méthodologie utilisée, le paradigme du monde visuel permettant d'observer des préférences d'interprétation on-line que ne permettent pas d'autres méthodes.</p>

<p>What does it take to acquire a semantic network in a second language? The present ERP study shows extremely rapid instantiation of both learned words and related concepts, via computerized games. Participants served as their own control. Electrical activity of the brain, recorded at the scalp, was examined prior to exposure with the second language and 8 days later, following a 6 day training session (preceded and followed by orientation and consolidation, respectively). Participants learned 12 words per day (nouns and verbs), for a total of 72 words over 6 consecutive days. Results show rapid changes in cortical activity, associated with learning. Prior to exposure, no modulation of the N400 component was found as a function of the correct match vs. mismatch of audio presentation of words and their associated images. Post training, a large N400 effect was found for mismatch trials compared to correctly matched audio-visual trials. More importantly, images that were semantically related to learned words (eg. for the learned word “horse” the image of a saddle was presented), produced a reduction of the N400 compared to mismatched pairs (eg. the image of a building followed by the auditory presentation of the same learned word “horse”). Our results attest to the plasticity of adult learners' brains and provide evidence for rapid onset of a semantic network in a late learned language. </p>

<p>The present study is part of an investigation concerning what and why basic features of the L2 remain non native like at very advanced stages of L2 acquisition.</p> <p> Focus is on the extent to which L1French-L2 English learners have internalized the intricate interplay of semantic and discourse criteria underlying the use of ongoingness marking on events in film retellings. Previous studies have shown that the availability or not of grammaticalized progressive marking has implications on the way events are sequenced and linked in narratives and influences focus of attention to certain perceptual or conceptual features of events (v. Stutterheim & al. 2013).</p> <p> Ongoingness marking is envisaged in 3 retelling tasks varying on memory load (1 online 2 offline). It is predicted that the proximity of the visual input will influence the frequency of progressive marking and coding of specific event types as ongoing vs. temporally bounded. Research questions are the following:</p> <p> - To what extent do situation types or features of events trigger ongoingness marking?</p> <p> - To what extent do discourse functions (backgrounding/framing) trigger ongoingness marking in the 3 elicitation conditions?</p> <p> - To what extent do criteria for selecting aspectual forms evidenced in L2 use converge and diverge with those of L1 English and L1 French in the context of the same tasks?</p> <p> The database comprises 3 groups of L2s and 3 control groups of L1English and L1French. Participants are all university students. L2 speakers' competence was tested all along their university studies as English majors.</p> <p> Findings</p> <p> The overall frequency of ongoingness marking (be+ -ing, start + gerund, there's + ing, as + be+-ing) decreases according to task in both L1 and L2 in order: online, offline medium and high memory load, confirming predictions.</p> <p> In the offline condition,frequency of progressives in the time line is significantly less in L2 than in L1. Learners tend to restrict ongoingness marking to background information. In the online condition occurrences are roughly equivalent but learners tend not to anchor events via 'now', which is systematic in L1.</p> <p>Contrarily to L1 speakers who typically express [-goal] events in the progressive (he is walking/looking around (73%)), learners hardly ever select those events for expression at all. In L1, they serve to establish an overarching temporal relation of inclusion to a set of events. This framing function is never attested in L2 data. Bounded events such as dig a hole tend to be coded with start + gerund more often in L2 than in L1.</p> <p>These results with be discussed in relation to the current debate on crosslinguistic influence in L2 use: Do the findings reflect persistent reliance on L1 patterns? a combination of L1 and L2 components in organizing information at discourse level? or do they reflect specific learner strategies?

<p>With the increased availability of digital texts and the development of user-friendly corpus tools, English for specific purposes (ESP) researchers have recently created discipline-specific wordlists to cater for the needs of their students by compiling specialized corpora (Wang, Liang, & Ge, 2008; Hsu, 2013; Ward 2009; Martinez, Beck, & Panza, 2009). While such specialized wordlists are helpful as a guide to design a coherent ESP program and to create teaching and learning materials, they can be much improved by adding phraseological and collocational information which can be obtained by re-analyzing the same corpora. Such direction is congruent with recent findings about the importance of multiword units (MWUs), also referred to as lexical bundles and chunks, as salient and functionally significant units and knowledge of these units crucial for fluent processing. They are recognized as “important building blocks of discourse (Biber, Conrad, & Cortes, 2004)” as well as “important means of differentiating written texts by discipline (Hyland, 2008)”. This research trend now extends to more professional written genres. Breeze (2013), for example, has investigated 4-word lexical bundles of four legal genres: academic law, case law, legislation, and documents.</p> <p>The present study explores ways to improve English radiology wordlists by adding information through the analysis of MWUs in the originally-built specialized corpora. The existing preliminary wordlists are staged in three levels, roughly targeting at lower-undergraduate, upper-undergraduate, and graduate levels. The first level list consists of 308 word families (e.g. symptom, infect, disorder, surgery, severe, therapy), the second level list consists of 342 word families (e.g. structure, beam, magnet, atom, scatter, resolution), and the third level list consists of 370 families (e.g. analyse, method, evaluate, significant, assess, ratio, estimate, correlate). These wordlists were derived from three individual corpora compiled from sources targeting audiences with different levels of specialized knowledge: (1) patient education materials, (2) introductory university textbooks, and (3) research articles. Through the MWU analysis, common collocations such as x-ray(s), blood clot(s), magnetic resonance imaging, are identified through bigram and trigram analyses. Also, terminology extraction using POS tags and phrase-frames (Fletcher, 2007) analyses are conducted.</p> <p>As a pedagogical practice, the improved first level list is made into online bilingual flash cards using a readily available web-based application. Feedback from students will be reported in the presentation.</p>

<p>In the field of L2 writing, coherence has been researched from the viewpoint of discourse analysis. However, cohesion, or a linguistic aspect of coherence, needs to be focused to develop an objective method of assessing coherence. Thus, this study investigates the characteristics of lexical reiteration, a part of lexical cohesion, in an English essay written by a Japanese EFL university student to explore its possibility of assessing coherence. The data was two essay scripts (first and second drafts) written responding to an argumentative essay task. The in-depth analysis involves segmenting the essays into sentences, identifying key concepts, and labeling them into eight categories of lexical reiteration, which are repetition, synonymy, antonymy, hyponymy, meronymy, co-hyponymy, co-meronymy, and metonymy. As a result, out of 171 pairs of sentences, 73 cases of lexical reiteration were observed in the first draft and the most frequently used category was synonymy. The second draft produced 210 pairs of sentences, 95 cases of lexical reiteration, which was regarded as improvement in coherence. The result also indicates that there were particular sentences and paragraphs which included more cases of lexical reiteration. The findings suggests that both linguistic and discourse analysis of coherence are necessary and too much emphasis on functional forms of a typically “good” argumentative essay may result in misunderstanding of what is coherent essay for novice L2 writers.</p>

<p>Les constructions ditransitives en chinois se caractérisent formellement par la structure à double objet et les structures avec la préposition Gei, et sémantiquement par un événement de possession causée. Si tous les verbes « ditransitifs » ne peuvent pas entrer librement dans ces constructions, c'est parce qu'ils sont sujets à des contraintes sémantiques lexicales (Zhu 1979, Liu 2006, entre autres). Dans l'usage des constructions ditransitives, le choix de la construction est sujet à l'accessibilité informationnelle et au poids des constituants qui représentent le récipient et le thème (Yao & Liu 2010, Yu 2013).</p> <p>Notre travail vise à examiner le processus d'acquisition des constructions ditransitives en chinois par des apprenants francophones. D'un côté, est-ce que les apprenants sont sensibles à l'interface des structures syntaxiques et des contraintes sémantiques lexicales ? De l'autre côté, est-ce qu'ils peuvent acquérir les contraintes informationnelles et du poids des constituants ?</p> <p>Pour répondre à la première question, une expérience incluant deux tâches a été lancée : une tâche de jugement d'acceptabilité pour examiner auprès des apprenants la conscience des restrictions des classes de verbe dans différentes constructions ainsi que la généralisation des paires forme-sens, et une tâche de traduction pour examiner la préférence des constructions dans la production des apprenants.</p> <p>Pour répondre à la deuxième question, une expérience de production semi-guidée a été réalisée : les apprenants ont été invités à formuler des phrases contenant une construction ditransitive selon les contextes et les (groupes de) mots donnés. Ils ont été censés choisir des (groupes de) mots et les mettre en bon ordre selon le contexte. Dans les contextes, l'accessibilité informationnelle du récipient et du thème est contrôlée. La longueur des syntagmes représentant le récipient et le thème est également manipulée.</p> <p>Une quarantaine d'apprenants francophones du chinois dans des établissements universitaires ont participé à la première expérience. Et une trentaine d'entre eux ont aussi participé à la deuxième expérience. Les résultats préliminaires des expériences montrent que les apprenants francophones du chinois acquièrent d'abord les formes syntaxiques de différentes constructions et au fur et à mesure raffinent les contraintes sémantiques. D'ailleurs, il existe un écart entre l'acquisition de l'interface sémantico-syntaxique et l'acquisition de l'interface poids-informationnel.</p> <p><strong>Références</strong> :</p> <p>Ambridge, B., Pine, J.

<p>Filled pauses (FPs) are common elements of spontaneous speech that perform paralinguistic functions, such as turn-taking (Rose 2008), speech planning and expressing uncertainty or disagreement (Fischer 2000). While the prosody of FPs, e.g. long duration and stable low pitch, is a universal feature (Vasilescu and Adda-Decker 2008), their timbre displays language-specific properties (Candea et al. 2005). For instance, English FPs are realized as an open central vowel (Candea et al. 2005), whereas Polish FPs fall in the regions of a mid or close-mid front vowel (Aperliński 2010).</p> <p><span>It has been shown that non-natives tend to import FPs from their L1, which may contribute to foreign-accentedness (Clark and Fox Tree 2002: 93). Recent work suggests that the native-like use of FPs might be important in L2 communicative competence (Rose 2008). However, there is little experimental research that would confirm the hypothesis that non-native use of FPs contributes to foreign-accentedness nor that native-like FPs improve communicative competence. </span></p> <p><span>The purpose of this study is to identify the role of FPs in the perception of foreign-accentedness and proficiency. One English and four Polish native speakers (C2 English proficiency level), two of whom were experienced pronunciation teachers, were recorded while performing a spoken gap-fill task in their L1 and L2 from which L1 and L2 FP tokens were extracted. Twenty English carrier sentences were recorded by the speakers, three of which were edited to include L1, L2 and no FP hesitations for each speaker. This procedure yielded fourty-two sentences which were used as stimuli for the perception survey. Perceptual data has been collected from twenty-six English native speakers so far (ongoing). The task involves listening to the randomized stimuli and rating each sentence using a 7-point Likert scale on accent and proficiency criteria. </span></p> <p><span>The data collected so far suggests that there is a statistically significant difference between the perceived accentedness of the speakers depending on the presence and type of FPs</span> in favor of no FP sentences. Pairwise comparisons revealed that the differences between individual conditions were also significant: Listeners rated the accent of speakers in sentences containing no FPs the highest, followed by sentences containing English FPs, with sentences containing Polish FPs receiving the lowest scores.</p> <p><span>Therefore, the results seem to confirm the anecdotal observation that non-native FPs negatively affect perceived accentedness and proficiency of speakers.</span></p> <p><strong>References:</strong></p> <p><span></span>Aperliński, Grzegorz. 2010.

<p>Phonological attrition as a result of language shift has been reported in the perception of geminate consonants by bilingual listeners (e.g., Celata and Cancila, 2010). However, no study has yet investigated attrition in the speech production of bilingual immigrant communities. In Farsi, consonant length has been reported as phonologically contrastive (e.g., [ajar] ‘carat' contrasts with [aj:ar] ‘brave'; Rafat, 2010). The current study focuses on the production of geminates in Farsi across three Farsi-English bilingual generations in Toronto, namely, first, second and 1.5 generations (cf., Rumbaut, 2004). Eleven participants whose ages ranged from 30-66 took part in the study. All participants completed a word-naming task in Farsi and a background questionnaire. Geminate and singleton durations were measured for sonorants /m,n,l,r,j/, fricatives /s,z,h/ and obstruents /p,t,k,b,d,q,tʃ,dʒ/ using Praat software (V.5.3.23). The preliminary acoustic analysis of 2463 tokens from the word-naming task suggests that the length contrast was categorically maintained in the first generation bilinguals, but not in the 1.5 and second generation groups. Moreover, when the data was collapsed across phonemes the following hierarchy was established with respect to the overall mean duration: control (159ms) > first generation (150ms) > second generation (126ms) > 1.5 generation (118ms). While the difference between the control group and the first generation group was not significant (p = 0.981), the results yielded a significant difference between the control group and the 1.5 generation (p = 0.037) and the control group and the second generation (p = 0.02). A hierarchy based on ‘sound class' was also established by conducting a between-phoneme comparison of the mean durations: Sonorants > fricatives > obstruents. The importance of the factor 'sound class' as a predictor of degemination echoes the findings in L2 acquisition of Italian geminate consonants by German, English, and Mandarin learners (e.g., Sorianello, 2014) and degemination patterns across the languages of the world (e.g., Blevins, 2004; Steriade, 1982). Based on these findings, we propose that perceptual salience, articulatory difficulty and markedness condition geminate attrition in language contact situations.</p> <p><strong>Keywords: Bilingual; phonology; attrition; sound change; geminate</strong></p> <p><strong>References</strong></p> <p>Blevins, J.

<p>This study investigated heritage speakers' processing of thematic roles in a picture-sentence verification task in Korean compared with native speakers(NSs) using event related potentials (ERPs). Knoeferle et al. (2011) found an N400 effect for the mismatch of the events between the picture and its corresponding sentence (e.g., The gymnast <span style="text-decoration: underline;">applauds/*punches</span> the journalist). The semantic-related N400 was predictable due to the mismatch of the semantic representations of the two verbs. However, the mismatch of the events between a picture and a sentence can be caused not only by the verbs but also by the switch of the thematic roles of the arguments (e.g., <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The man</span> sees <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the woman</span> vs. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The woman</span> sees <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the man</span>). In such cases, two hypotheses are possible: an N400 will be elicited if the parser processes the mismatch as a semantic violation whereas an ELAN and/or a P600 is expected if the parser processes it as a syntactic violation. Lee, Jeong & Nam (2014) found P600 for mismatch of thematic roles in a picture-sentence verification task caused by case markers in native speakers of Korean. This study investigated how heritage speakers of Korean response to the same task. HS often showed native-like behavior in the behavioral language task with simple linguistic features such as case markers. However, their brain-responses might be different from NSs due to their incomplete acquisition of the language (Montrul, 2007). For example, second language learners often showed semantically related brain responses (i.e., N400 rather than P600) to syntactic anomaly indicating their use of different strategies in the processing of the same structure from NSs (e.g., Guo et al. 2009). Lee & Jeong's (2014) findings on the processing of case markers in Korean found similar results for the sematic incongruence caused by case markers (e.g., Agent-NOM/*ACC + Verb): N400 in heritage speakers and P600 in native speakers. This study reports the results of different analysis from Lee & Jeong (2014), focusing on the mismatch of thematic roles caused by switching the argument of the sentence (e.g., Agent/*Patient-NOM, Pagent/*Agent-ACC) in a picture-sentence verification task with auditory stimuli.</p> <p>EEG data were collected from 11 heritage speakers and 18 native speakers of Korean regarding two conditions: (A) Agent mismatch, [Agent/*Patient-NOM + Verb, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">brother/*sister</span>-ka cathes_], (B) Patient mismatch, [Patient/*Agent-ACC + Verb, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sister/*brother</span>-lul catches_ ]. The ERPs were compared at the case markers and verbs. Preliminary results showed that native speakers revealed P600 at the verbs but not at the case markers for mismatch condition whereas heritage speakers showed N400. The findings can be interpreted in such way that heritage speakers' processing of thematic roles in a picture sentence verification task is different from native speakers' probably due to their incomplete acquisition of syntactic features such as case markers and voice morphology. More detailed results and their implications will be discussed.</p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-family: 굴림; font-size: medium;"> </span></p>

<p>Of particular interest in this study is the link between morphology and phonology. Using the method of event-related potentials (ERP), it compares the processing of three inflectional verbal forms in Russian (infinitive, future, and past-tense forms), which are distinguished on the basis of a phonological contrast in the same word position, e.g., ответи<span style="text-decoration: underline;">ть</span> (atvjetitj ANSWERINF)—ответи<span style="text-decoration: underline;">т</span> (atvjetit ANSWERFUTURE)—ответи<span style="text-decoration: underline;">л</span> (atvjetil ANSWERPAST). The goal was to examine how early morpho-phonological predictions are built during speech comprehension and whether the ERP response is modulated by the phonetic proximity of the phonological contrasts distinguishing the morphological forms during auditory sentence comprehension by native (L1) and nonnative (L2) speakers of Russian.</p> <p>Three triplets of 270 sentences included 90 critical, 90 control and 90 filler sentences. Critical sentences were divided into 30 morphologically congruent infinitive forms (V+ть, /tj/), 30 incongruent future-tense verbs (V+т, /t/), and 30 incongruent past-tense verbs (V+л, /l/) each, e.g.:</p> <p>Личный помощник президента хочет <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ОТВЕТИТЬ</span>INF/<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> *ОТВЕТИТ</span>FUTURE/<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> *ОТВЕТИ</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Л</span>PAST на провокационный вопрос журналиста.</p> <p>President's personal assistant wants to<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> ANSWER</span>INF/<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> *ANSWER</span>FUTURE/ <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ANSWER</span>PAST the journalist's provocative question.</p> <p>Twenty-one L1 and 15 highly proficient L2 speakers of Russian participated in the study. The task was to listen to sentences and judge their goodness.</p> <p>For the L1 group, ERP waveforms time-locked to target word offsets revealed an early positivity in the post-word 100-600 ms latency window followed by a pronounced late negativity in the 600-1300 ms window for both morphologically incongruent conditions (future and past-tense forms). The ERP effects were mostly pronounced in the centro-parietal area and no modulation of the brain response by the phonetic similarity was observed.</p> <p>The L2 group showed a different pattern of results. While a similar to L1 group early positivity was elicited for the incongruent past-tense forms, no difference between congruent and incongruent future-tense forms was observed. This finding suggests that, while L2 listeners are sensitive to morphological violations during auditory sentence comprehension, their ERP response is modulated by phonetic distance. </p> <p>Such modulation is due to the perceptual ambiguity between hard (/t/) and soft (/tj/) Russian consonants—the phonological contrast that is notoriously difficult for the English-speaking learners of Russian. In case of such low-level phonological problem, L2 listeners exhibit a morphological context bias effect and select the interpretation of the sentence that is most compatible with the morphological predictions at no cost for the parser; hence, no difference in the ERP response is observed.</p>

<p>Studies of bilingual children's phonological profile have mainly focused on the description and assessment of phonetic inventories (Goldstein & Washington 2001, Anderson 2004). Considerably less attention has been paid to their suprasegmental aspects of the language of bilingual children and how they are acquired in comparison to segmental production.</p> <p>In this study, we focus on the prosodic competence of Polish-English bilingual children, specifically the word stress. Its acquisition has been widely discussed in the literature on SLA in adults (Archibald 1993, 1994) Young‑Sholten 1993), but is quite unexplored in the case of bilingual children. Our study investigates whether the acquisition of stress is qualitatively different from the acquisition of segmental phonology in children and whether it is sensitive to the crosslinguistic influence from Polish, their parental language (L1).</p> <p>To answer our research question, we tested 22 Polish-English bilingual children (mean age 5;4, SD 10,5 months) residing in England on a non-word repetition task (NWR) in English, their environmental language (L2). The English version of the NWR consisted of 60 items of varying length, syllable structure complexity, and stress pattern (Szewczyk et al., 2012). Some of the non-words contained secondary stress, in standard and non-standard combinations. All stimuli were presented auditorily via headphones and children's task was to repeat them. Their productions were recorded, transcribed and auditorily assessed by three independent raters from the perspective of segmental and prosodic faithfulness. The assessment was binary in that no point was assigned for any deviation from the input form, independently in segmental and suprasegmental columns. Positive value was assigned only in the case of faithful mapping of segments or stress. The columns were subsequently compared on the numbers of points.</p> <p>The preliminary results reveal that children repeat segments with 34% correctness, whereas prosodic faithfulness is at the level of 93%. This difference is statistically significant (p<0.001). High prosodic competence is manifested e.g. in faithful mapping of secondary stress, regardless of how non-standard the input stress pattern is. Moreover, the results indicate that prosodic faithfulness reaches high levels independently of the age of our respondents. All these findings suggest that, unlike L2 segmental phonology, L2 prosody of bilingual children is resistant to CLI.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>References:</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Anderson, R.

<p>Listening in a foreign language is a highly demanding task. L2 learners typically perform worse in listening than in reading comprehension (van Zeeland, 2013), and are acutely aware of it (Farrel & Mallard, 2006), which may in turn affect their motivation for, and attitude towards, listening tasks (Xu, 2011; Bloomfield et al., 2010). Successful listening requires a broad set of subskills ranging from perception to comprehension, i.e. from "low-level" speech signal decoding processes to "high-level" integrative mechanisms, including inference.</p> <p>For years, listening comprehension skills have been assessed rather than taught in language classrooms (Field, 2008). Most of the effort that has eventually been devoted to teaching listening has focused on (meta-)cognitive listening strategies, with varying degrees of success (Berne, 2004), and very little at all with low-proficiency learners (Renandya & Farrell, 2010). Consequently, some researchers have argued in favor of alternative teaching methods designed at developing low-level processing of oral language through extensive listening (Renandya, 2011) or targeted exercices based on the "word-spotting task" (Cutler & Shanley, 2010).</p> <p>In this paper, we discuss the results of two studies which, using a pre-test/post-test design, assessed the efficiency of two learning sequences implementing contrasting methods for teaching listening to teenage French EFL learners from Belgium. Study 1 tested a learning sequence based on both implicit (using the word-spotting task) and explicit teaching of word boundary detection using two cues that have proven useful for native English speakers: (i) lexical stress, and (ii) phonotactic constraints. Study 2 evaluated the success of a learning sequence focussing on listening strategies in an integrated teaching approach.</p> <p>First, the efficiency of the learning sequences were assessed by comparing performances in pre- vs. post-tests. Second, learning processes were investigated by analyzing performances in similar exercices included within the learning sequences. Third, the attitudes and self-reported practices of the participants in relation with listening comprehension were documented (before & after intervention), as well as their opinion on the usefulness of the learning sequence (after intervention), to be confronted with the learners' performances at each step of the procedure.</p> <p>First results suggested that (i) the learning sequence focussing on "low-level" word segmentation processes was more effective than the learning sequence based on cognitive listening strategies; (ii) the improvement in the performances from pre-test to post-test did not result from a particular didactic mean, but from a combination of teaching practices and speech materials (including individual exercises and theory building in group sessions, implicit and explicit learning, etc.); (iii) students who were self-reportedly focused on the listening task and approached it with a positive attitude performed better. The implications of these findings will be discussed at the conference.</p>

<p>Ma and ne are two well-known Chinese sentence final particles (SFPs) in terms of their sentence-typing functions. But the use of SFP ma in a rhetorical question and ne as a follow-up question marker (as shown in 1a and 1b) are not well studied. More interestingly, the actual attitude of the speaker is right the opposite of the surface meaning of the ma sentence. And in an out-of-the-blue context, the use of SFP ne is not appropriate (Constant, 2011). And all these constrains are due to the features attached to ma and ne. However, English doesn't have any of these SFPs, but it has some of these features (same features on rhetorical yes-no questions). But the feature attached to SFP ne cannot be found in English as it is not a requisite for wh-questions.</p> <p>1. a. Zhè shì yí gè dà rén yīnggāi zuòde ma?</p> <p>This is one CL big people should done DE MA</p> <p>Is this what an adult should do?</p> <p>True meaning: ‘This is not what an adult should do'.</p> <p>b.Wǒ xǐhuān chī zhōngguócài, nǐ xǐhuān chī shénme ne?</p> <p>I like eat Chinese dish, you like eat what NE</p> <p> ‘I like to eat Chinese dishes, what about you?'</p> <p> </p> <p>This present study explores the acquisition of Chinese SFP rhetorical ma and SFP ne with three research questions: i) Can features attached to ma and ne be acquired by English-speaking L2 learners? ii) How learners fulfil the reassembly tasks? iii) Is there any developmental acquisition among learner groups?</p> <p> </p> <p>An empirical study is now in progress. Four L2 groups (beginner's, intermediate, advanced and near-native) and one Chinese native control group will participate in this research. The instruments include an acceptability judgment test, a comprehension test and a sentence ranking test. I anticipate that features attached to SFP ma, namely those are also present in learners' L1, will be acquired ultimately; however, those cannot be found in their L1 will not be acquired. For the reassembly tasks, learners will initially map ma and ne as the yes-no and wh-question respectively, and then with positive evidence they will identify the problems thus trigger the mapping of ma as the rhetorical yes-no question marker. Some developmental acquisition will be identified in this process. For the non-acquisition of feature attached to ne, it may probably due to the lack of both positive and negative evidence. To conclude, this study will contribute to Lardiere (2009) ‘Feature Reassembly Hypothesis' and also fulfil the gap by arguing that those features are not exist in L1 but required in L2 may be quite difficult for L2 learners. At the same time, this study will enhance our understanding of the functions of SFP ma and ne.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Reference:</p> <p>Constant, N. (2011).

<p>Recently, there has been great interest in the second language acquisition (SLA) literature in identifying the differences between second language (L2) learners and heritage language (HL) learners. Among other conclusions, most researchers agree that L2 learners outperform HL learners when examining writing abilities (Montrul, 2010, 2012; Hedgcock, & Lefkowitz, 2011; Potowski, 2014).</p> <p>An awareness of these different pedagogical needs (Carreira, 2004; Montrul & Perpiñán 2011; Potowski, 2002) has led to a growing number of post-secondary institutions in the United States to the creationof courses designed for heritage language learners, especially for Spanish heritage language learners, since it is the largest population of heritage language in the USA. The effects on instruction on writing skills are still an empirical question. Furthermore, this study also concerns whether HL learners still remain at a disadvantage when compared to their L2 counterparts' writing skills after completing a similar course designed for each population's needs. To date, no study has provided an answer to this question.</p> <p>The present study sought to shed some light into this issue. We sampled twelve HL learners and twelve L2 Spanish learners enrolled in tailor-made courses specifically designed to meet HL and L2 needs. All groups completed two time-controlled written production tasks, one during the first weeks of the semester and the other at the end of the semester. Their written proficiency was assessed by measuring the complexity, accuracy and fluency and lexis (CAF, Norris & Ortega 2009) of the texts they produced.</p> <p>Preliminary results suggest that HS writing performance as measured by CAF is not significantly different from their L2 counterparts after taking a HS course, slightly outperforming L2 learners at the end of the semester. Findings, suggesting that tailor-made instruction is beneficial for leveling these two groups of learners, are discussed in light of their pedagogical implications for the L2/HL classroom, and could also help instructors and language program directors develop curricular designs better adapted to the learners' diverse needs.</p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>References</strong>: </p> <p>Carreira, M.

<p>The current study is embedded in the ongoing debate about vocabulary learning, and whether explicit vocabulary instruction in the foreign-language classroom leads to the same language competence as implicit, first-language acquisition (Krashen, 2003). Mnemonic techniques are one option for explicit vocabulary instruction, and one of the most researched techniques in the field of SLA has been the keyword method, first studied by Atkinson and Raugh (1975). In the keyword mnemonic a word in the native language that is orthographically similar to the target foreign word is used to link the target word and its translation via an interactive image. Some studies have shown that treatment groups using the keyword method perform better on recognition and recall tasks than control groups, but others have called into question the usefulness of this technique, raising concerns about ‘mnemonic dependence', slower word retrieval and interference with future vocabulary learning (van Hell & Candia Mahn, 1997). The hypothesis for the current experiment is that use of the keyword method might impair future lexical acquisition because of the confusing, artificial semantic associations that it creates. To test this theory an experiment was designed in which L1 English-speaking participants learned a set of German words using either the keyword method or rote rehearsal. All participants learned the first set of words to 100% accuracy, and then received a second set to learn. Words in the second set were categorized as either novel or non-novel. Novel items had never been seen before by either group while non-novel items had been seen only by the keyword group because these items had been used as keyword links for target items in the 1st phase. It was predicted that, for non-novel target items, recall accuracy would be lower and recognition latency higher for the keyword group. The results of the study were intriguing, though only marginally significant. All of the data trended in the direction predicted, but only the one-way ANOVA for the cued recall data revealed a marginally significant interaction of group and word novelty (whether target items had previously been used as keywords or not). Marginally significant between-group differences were also found for recall and reaction time for old words only. It is likely that straightforward modifications to the current experiment (such as refining the choice of target items) would address most of the limitations and show more statistically robust results. This study suggests that due to the trending in the data, future research in this area is warranted and could contribute to psycholinguistic theory regarding lexical acquisition, as well as inform pedagogical practices in foreign-language classrooms.</p> <p> </p> <p>Atkinson, R.C., & Raugh, M.R.

<p>Labiodental fricatives /f/ and /v/ are not shared between Bengali and English. In the early stages of learning this should, according to the Perceptual Assimilation Model (Best, 1995), amount to good discrimination between the two L2 sounds as English /f/ and /v/ are both assimilated, but not categorized, within the L1 phonological space. For advanced or bilingual learners, the Speech Learning Model (Flege, 1995) proposes that new category formation will occur, facilitating both perception and production which should outperform that of those sounds which are perceived as ‘similar' to existing categories in the L1. </p> <p> </p> <p>This paper focuses on the discrepancies in both the perception and production of L2 English word-initial /f/ and /v/ from two L1 Bengali adult speakers as part of a pilot simulated longitudinal study. As a pilot, the simulated longitudinal study was primarily intended to determine whether evidence of speech learning of sounds, both shared and not shared between the L1 and L2, could be assessed by a process of extrapolation, in imitation of a true longitudinal study. That is, the production and perception of L2 sounds between adult learners from the same L1 background with differing linguistic experience, given a difference of some twenty years in L2 language experience. An AX word discrimination test was used to test perception, whereby the learner was asked to identify two tokens as either similar or different. For production, an imitation production test was conducted with tokens complimenting the perception test, whereby the learners were asked to repeat tokens, which were then transcribed by three native speakers of English as an acceptability judgement test. Only three corresponding acceptance judgements were taken as evidence of intelligibility.

In other words, the elementary or naïve learner, in the early stages of learning, had the ability to both perceive and produce L2 /f/ better than the advanced/bilingual learner. At the same time, the elementary learner was unable to produce any L2 word with word-initial /v/ in a target-like fashion, and all transcriptions were annotated with /b/. Whilst the advanced/bilingual learner was able to produce a ‘target-like' /v/ in approximately 50% of expected language occasions, the payoff in the production of /f/ was seemingly compromised.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>References</p> <p>Best, C.

<p> Prevailing theory in bilingualism posits that a bilingual's two languages are constantly active, even when only one is in use (the non-selectivity hypothesis). This creates an attentional control problem in bilinguals that is resolved through increased executive control (EC; the locus of domain-general conflict resolution and conflict monitoring) as compared to monolinguals (e.g., Bialystok, 2009). However, this bilingual benefit is often difficult to observe (e.g., Costa et al., 2009). Recent research has begun recognizing the lack of consistency in tasks measuring EC, finding mixed results for reliability and validity for the Simon and flanker tasks (Paap & Greenberg, 2013) and large error terms for the Stroop task in structural equation modeling (Miyake & Friedman, 2012). The present study is the first to incorporate the Stroop, Simon, and flanker tasks—tasks with nearly identical task demands—and is the first to analyze reliability and validity of four different effects that can each be calculated in the same manner from each task.</p> <p> Nineteen monolingual and 34 bilingual participants took the Stroop task (1935), the Simon task (Simon & Rudell, 1967), and attentional network task (ANT; Fan et al., 2002) version of the flanker task (Eriksen & Eriksen, 1974) in a counterbalanced order, after which they completed a standardized language history questionnaire (LHQ; Li et al., 2006). These three EC tasks are used interchangeably in contemporary bilingualism literature with inconsistent task features (e.g., task length, color words vs. numbers for the Stroop), and with inconsistent statistical analyses. Effects derived from these tasks (the conflict, interference, monitoring, and facilitation effects) are also used interchangeably to investigate the bilingual benefits of EC and recent extensions to individual differences research (e.g., Mercier et al., 2014). An investigation into the convergent and divergent validity of the conflict, interference, monitoring, and facilitation effects as measures of executive control calculated from each of the three tasks was undertaken with a multi-trait multi-method (MTMM) analysis.</p> <p> Results indicated monolinguals showed faster reaction times (RTs) overall compared to bilinguals, and no consistent EC benefits were found for the bilingual participants. Low reliability estimates were found for a majority of tasks conditions. Further, despite theory holding that all three of these tasks measure the same constructs, the trends of the tasks differed: the Stroop toward the bilingual benefit, the ANT favoring monolinguals, and the Simon with a mixed interpretation. Moreover, the MTMM analysis revealed that RT differences commonly interpreted as indicating conflict, interference, and facilitation effects correlated highly with one another within each task (a lack of divergent validity evidence), while not correlating well with what was supposed to be the corresponding effect across tasks (a lack of convergent validity evidence). Only the monitoring effect exhibited evidence for convergent validity. Suggestions are made for future research to standardize and create reliable task measures of executive control, so researchers can be more confident these tasks are measuring what they purport to measure. </p>

<p>A substantial body of research has demonstrated that there are predictable cross-linguistic differences in how speakers of different languages conceptualize the world, suggesting that language may shape cognition. Much of the current debate in this line of research centers on to what extent language modulates our patterns of cognition. While some studies (e.g., Bunger, Papafragou, & Trueswell, 2013; Papafragou, Hulbert, & Trueswell, 2008; Slobin, 1996, 2000) have revealed that language specificity only emerges in preverbal thought, others (e.g., Fausey & Boroditsky, 2010, 2011; Levinson, 1996, 1997; Lucy, 1992; Park & Ziegler, 2014) are in support of the notion of linguistic relativity, claiming that language-specific effects may even appear in general, non-linguistic thought. Notwithstanding the considerable evidence for linguistic relativity, its credibility has often been challenged as nonlinguistic tasks employed in existing studies are open to methodological and interpretation criticisms. </p> <p>To investigate the notion of linguistic relativity with more precision, the present study compared categorization preferences for motion events of Korean-English bilingual speakers (N=80) against those of Korean and English functional monolingual speakers (N=15 each). Results indicated that there were statistically significant differences between the two monolingual groups and that the bilingual speakers' categorization patterns resembled those of the Korean speakers. Correlation and regression analyses further demonstrated that their categorization preferences were modulated by the length of immersion in an L2-speaking country, not necessarily by their L2 proficiency. When the bilingual group was split into two subgroups by their immersion experience (immersion group vs. non-immersion group) for additional analyses, the findings demonstrated that different background factors predicted variance in the categorization scores of the two bilingual groups. While the length of immersion in an L2-speaking country predicted the scores of the immersion group at 13%, the scores of the non-immersion group were estimated by L2 study length at 14%. These results suggest that for late bilinguals who have never gone abroad, their preference to categorize motion events more like English monolinguals would be moderately conditioned by how long they have studied the L2. However, once bilinguals undergo varying lengths of immersion experience, it is these experiences (and likely the length, intensity, and quality of naturalistic use of the L2 they may afford) that seem to better predict how much bilinguals are influenced in their non-linguistic behavior by categorization patterns favored by the target grammar.</p>

<p>Native and non-native sounds are generally assumed to coexist and interact in a common inter-phonological space in bilinguals. Within this space, the production of non-native sounds is determined by their similarity to native categories: the closer an L2 sound is to a native one, the more likely it is that this native sound will be used to produce the L2 sound. Interestingly, the production of a native sound is also modified as a result of its proximity to non-native sounds. Similar L1 and L2 sounds have been shown to converge towards one intermediate category in bilinguals. Our study investigates the interactions between the production of native and non-native vowels during learning, i.e., before and after articulatory feedback training with non-native sounds.</p> <p>Twenty monolingual native French speakers were trained to produce two novel vowels: Danish /o/ (perceptually similar to the French /o/) and Russian /<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">i</span>/ (no similar French category, a ‘dissimilar' sound). On each trial, participants repeated a target vowel and received immediate visual feedback in the form of a two-dimensional plot of F1/F2 space. In this display, participants saw a point representing the position of their own production together with that of the target vowel space. Each vowel was repeated 600 times across 3 training days. Production of Danish /o/ and Russian /<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">i</span>/ and of the respective acoustically closest French /o/ and /ø/ vowels was assessed before and after training. The position of the vowels and their compactness (the inverse of variability) in the acoustic space were computed for each participant. The Mahalanobis distance was used to assess distances between the native and non-native vowel categories.</p> <p>The compactness of the French vowels was related to the accuracy and compactness in the production of non-native vowels, before training. Training improved the production of non-native vowels on average by 19%, with no difference in improvement between vowels. After training, there was a global drift in the position of the French /ø/ vowel: it moved closer to the Russian /ɨ/. There was no change in the overall position of the French /o/ vowel relative to the Danish /o/. However, strong positive correlations in training-related changes in F1 and F2 between the two vowels, demonstrated that they moved in the same direction. There were no training-related changes in the compactness of the native vowels.</p> <p>Our results show that (1) before training, individual differences in the degree of compactness of native categories is related to the production performance on non-native closest sounds; (2) one hour of articulatory training with non-native sounds changes the production of native sounds, with drift towards the non-native ones. To conclude, our results suggest that interactions in the production of L1 and L2 sounds previously shown in L2 proficient and bilingual speakers are already present in novice learners on the basis of very little L2 exposure.</p>

<p>Bilingual children differ from their monolingual peers in language development (Bialystok et al., 2010). Although bilingualism results in significant cognitive benefits later in the lifetime, any peculiarities or delays in linguistic development of child bilinguals may be misinterpreted due to the erroneous use of monolingual norms and research tools (Armon-Lotem, 2012). To counteract this problem, it is essential to examine the child in his/her two languages using adequate procedures to reduce assessment bias.</p> <p>Sentence Repetition Tasks (SRT) are speech elicitation tools used to assess both monolingual and bilingual linguistic abilities. Properly designed SRTs tap into implicit linguistic knowledge and allow for accessing internalized grammatical representations (cf. Marinis & Armon-Lotem, 2015). To serve their diagnostic functions, the English and Polish SRTs used in the present study (Marinis et al., 2011; Banasik et al., 2012) were carefully developed in terms of morphosyntactic complexity and lexical item selection, taking into account word frequency and age of acquisition. The tasks consist of, respectively, 60/68 sentences and target 15/17 structures organized in three blocks of increasing complexity, including, the use of auxiliaries, modals, negation, wh-questions, passives, bi-clausal sentences, relative clauses, clefts and conditionals.</p> <p>Here, we present data of an in-progress study on the morphosyntactic development of Polish-English bilingual preschoolers raised in the UK (N=30) matched for age and socio-economic status with Polish monolinguals (N=30). The mean age of the whole sample is 67 months. Following the scoring schemes for SRT (Marinis & Armon-Lotem, 2015) we calculated the number of exact verbatim repetitions of stimulus sentences, overall grammaticality of each output sentence, and the number of changes (i.e. omissions, additions, substitutions) in the realm of the lexical items, functional words and inflectional morphemes. We also applied a structure-oriented scoring scheme, in which the targeted grammatical construction (e.g. negation, passive, wh-question) was isolated from the structure-irrelevant linguistic material (e.g. adjunct phrases) and subjected to binary assessment (right-wrong).</p> <p>Our partial results calculated for Polish show that the monolingual group significantly outperformed their bilingual counterparts on most scales, excluding simple wh-questions and bi-clausal sentences. The most pronounced difficulties were noted for verb phrases with auxiliaries, modals and negation, as well as for object relative clauses and long passives. However, as revealed by linear regression analyses, initially less developed Polish morphosyntactic abilities of bilinguals progress steadily with age to approximate the level of the linguistic skills of their monolingual counterparts. As for the comparison of the languages of the bilingual children, we did not find significant differences in the acquisition of the corresponding Polish and English structures, except for wh-questions, which turned out to be significantly better developed in Polish than in English.</p> <p>In the discussion part, the obtained results are interpreted in relation to the quantity and type of linguistic input (i.e. environmental vs. home language), selected social and sociolinguistic factors as well as the current theories of bilingual development.</p>

<p>Our aim was to determine whether the production of intonation contours by French students of English improved over the course of their first three years at university. Nineteen 1st year, sixteen 2nd year, thirty-four 3rd year students, as well as four native speakers of English, were asked to read a dialogue that we had specially designed to elicit specific intonation contours. The recordings were manually segmented into intonation phrases (IPs), and the fundamental frequency (F0) of each of the (52 contours × 73 participants =) 3796 IPs was computed with Praat software. Due to variation in the duration of each token of the same type of IP, and the resulting varying number of F0 values per token, resampling was performed so that each IP was eventually characterized by the same number of F0 values (11). Objective frequency values were then converted to semitones with reference to 1 Hz for more relevance in terms of perception. In order to compensate for individual differences in average F0 – partly arising from biological constraints – the minimum pitch value in each IP was subtracted from the other values. We then chose one native speaker and computed the Euclidean distance between each IP for each participant and the native's corresponding IP. Our expectation was that the distance between a learner's F0 pattern and the corresponding native F0 pattern for a given IP would decrease as we go from 1st to 2nd, and then from 2nd to 3rd year students. One-way analyses of variance were performed, one for each IP, with Level (1st, 2nd or 3rd year) as the between-subjects factor and Distance as the dependent variable. Out of the 46 analyses (6 IPs had to be discarded), only five reached statistical significance, showing improvement for contours 16 (“Do you know what the Dalai Lama said at Subway”) and 18 (“What did he say?”), and worsening in the remaining 3 IPs. Note however that individual variation was substantial.</p> <p>It remains to be seen if this small number of significant comparisons stems from the students genuinely failing to achieve better intonation contours over the years or if our metric, despite our efforts to factor out non-linguistic individual differences, turns out to be too crude. We are currently working on more fine-grained parameters involving the segmentation of a subset of our IPs into syllables, and the final presentation will include results from a perceptual experiment, which will be correlated with acoustic cues.</p>

<p>When comparing L2 learner and L1 novice writing in French some differences have caught our attention and made us want to investigate them further. There are some errors that are quite frequent in L1 writing and almost non-existent in French L2 guided learner writing except in very advanced L2 users having developed automatisms. A typical example is the homophone errors. A French child learning to write often has problems with homophones, whole words as well as grammatical endings. Therefore, he can write vert when aiming to write verre, ver or vers, or *j'ai regarder instead of j'ai regardé. (Brissaud et al. 2006 ; Gunnarsson & Largy 2010). Something a guided French L2 learner would almost never do (Gunnarsson-Largy 2013).</p> <p>According to the models of written production where the function working memory is integrated (Hayes 1996; Kellogs 1996), it is the articulatory/phonological loop that plays a decisive role in the formulation/translation process, i.e. when the ideas come to words to be graphically executed in the next process. Furthermore, the homophone errors in L1 writing are the result of a mismatch between the phonological sequence and what is retrieved in the mental lexicon and/or grammar. The L1 writer often retrieves the most frequent spelling.</p> <p>As these errors are much less frequent in L2 learner writing, it seems as if phonology plays a much smaller role during the formulation/translation process than in L1 writing. Whether this is due to formulation in L1 translated into L2 and before writing it down, to a stronger use of the visuo-spatial sketchpad in the working memory or to a stronger pre-graphic control, we cannot say at this stage.</p> <p>In order to explore the importance of phonology during the formulation/translation process and at different L2 levels, we have designed an experimental protocol where we force the French L2 writers (beginners, intermediate, and advanced) to rely on and take phonology in consideration in a dictation task and compare their performance to that of French L1 children (1st, 4th and 6th grade). The dictation task explores the treatment of the negation ne...pas where the /n/ could be a liaison consonant or an elided n' in a negation: On est dans la rue vs. On n'est pas dans la rue. The protocol consisting of two lists of 24 sentences (12 with negation and 12 without) has been submitted to 3 groups of 20 French L2 learners, 1 beginner, 1 intermediate and 1 advanced, and 3 groups of 20 French L1 children, 1 first grade, 1 fourth grade and 1 sixth grade.</p> <p>We formulate the hypothesis that the marking of the n' in the negation will increase with age in the French L1 children while it will be marked form the start in the French L2 learners. If the advanced L2 learners start decreasing in the marking, this will be an indication of a change in the formulation process, which has in that case become more L1 like.</p>

<p>In this paper we use eye-tracking methodology to investigate the relationships among the effect of captions in video-based listening, the processing of captions, orthographical distance between the first and second languages, and working memory (WM) capacity in the context of dual processing theory. In particular, we investigate the dual processing theory of working memory (WM). WM includes an auditory working memory and a visual working memory, each with limited capacity (Baddeley, 1974, 2003), consistent with Sweller's cognitive load theory (1994). According to these theories, WM is likely to become overburdened when learners are presented with audio, images and captions at the same time. This goes against research that has shown that captions are beneficial for developing listening skills (Perez, Noortgate, & Desmet, 2013; Winke, Gass & Sydorenko, 2010; Gass, Winke, Ahn, 2015). In this study we examine how learners integrate multiple representations of verbal (captions), aural (audio), and visual (images) information during video-based listening activities. Our research is guided by three research questions: 1) Do learners with high WM capacity outperform learners with low WM capacity in video-based listening and, if so, is this effect of WM more pronounced when captions are present than when they are not?; 2) what is the relationship between the processing of captions and L2 comprehension? Are there differences between successful learners' and less-successful learners' eye-movement?, and 3) what is the effect of script differences in relation to working memory?</p> <p> </p> <p>We present data from three groups of learners: 1) learners of Spanish (n=46), 2) learners of Chinese (data collection ongoing), and 3) learners of Arabic (data collection ongoing). Half of each group was randomly assigned to a caption group and the other half to a non-caption group. They took two WM tests (reading span and visuo-spatial span). Next each participant watched a video twice with the eye tracking system, and then took two comprehension tests (free recall and multiple-choice). In the analysis of the Spanish data the results show that learners with a higher verbal WM outperformed the learners with a lower verbal WM. Based on eye-tracking data, learners with lower scores on the free recall test spent more time rereading the captions than the learners with higher scores. These findings partially support the dual processing theory as well as cognitive load theory in that the learners with low WM capacity showed relatively poor performance on the free recall test. We propose that due to the limited capacity of WM, the low WM learners in the caption group might have had a greater cognitive burden than the high WM learners when processing three sources of information: captions, images, and audio. However, the effect of WM was not more pronounced in the caption condition than in the non-caption condition, which implies that captioning was still effective even for the low WM learners. These results will be further discussed in relation to data from languages with different scripts. </p>

<p align="left">Learning a second language (L2) is both a cognitive and emotional process (Swain, 2013). At the core of the emotion process is the approach-avoidance appraisal of a stimulus, which gives L2 learners energy and direction to act in real-time interactions with the environment. Even though a large body of interaction research has investigated the role of language input and output, and of interlocutors' feedback in different contexts, looking at cognitive processes, the affective dimension of interaction-driven L2 learning has not yet been delved into. This project furthers interaction research by empirically investigating, with a Dynamic Systems perspective, how different learners' affective factors (i.e. anxiety) impact what they are willing and able to listen and attend to and what they produce in negotiation-generating tasks. A total of 24 learners of L2 Italian carry out two task-based interactions with a native and a nonnative speaker. They subsequently re-watch their interactions and rate, through a software, how anxiety rises and falls during interaction (Idiodynamic rating, MacIntyre, 2012). The triangulation of data from questionnaires (trait variables), language tasks, real-time ratings of emotions (state variables), and interviews aims at providing a comprehensive description of how the emergence and development of emotions (i.e. language anxiety) can impact how learners notice feedback and learn from L2 interactions. Findings will have pedagogical implications on possible strategies for both L2 learners and teachers to manage emotions in interaction-based L2 learning, so that affective factors are channeled to foster L2 development.</p>

<p>The emergence of English as a foreign language has brought about considerable changes in theories of language learning. It challenged, more particularly, established conceptualizations of language learning motivation, as in the growing number of foreign language (FL) contexts, the traditional concept of integrative motivation (Gardner, 2001) made little sense. Lamb (2004) reinterpreted FL learners' positive attitudes to native speakers as a manifestation of their bicultural identity, and Pavlenko & Norton (2007) proposed the notion of imagined communities, accessible to all learners.</p> <p>Consequently, learners' self-concept became the focal point of the L2 Motivational Self System (Dörnyei, 2009), which offers a dynamic approach to motivated learning behavior. While the model maintains close links to established theories, it also fits into the multi-framework view required to address motivational phenomena in the large variety of modern learning contexts.

Similarly, attitudes toward native speakers were positive throughout the whole sample, whereas learners' language-related future self-visions were surprisingly low.

<p>Reaction time experiments are widely used to look at differences in L1 and L2 language processing. Apart from perhaps the most advanced speakers of an L2, results consistently show language performance to be slower in an L2; however, this does not provide much insight into the reasons why L2 processing is generally slower, or into the nature of language processing.</p> <p>Traditional analyses of reaction time data are based on mean response times, and are thus limited to looking at differences in the average speed of language processing in L1 and L2. In other fields of cognitive science, spectral analysis is used to look at variability in response time data that has traditionally been regarded as irrelevant ‘noise' but has been found to reveal the degree of automatisation of mental processes (van Orden, Holden, Turvey, 2003). Looking at patterns of variability using a word naming task in L1 and L2 allows us to look beyond the speed of processing at the difference in optimal coordination using the mother tongue (L1) and a second language (L2).</p> <p>Word naming consists of two components; a perception task/reading, and a production task/pronouncing. Both components will affect the results of a naming task. In order to try and separate these in the results, two versions of the naming task were run on two different groups of participants. 40 advanced learners of English were randomly divided into two groups. One group of participants was tested on simple L1 (Dutch) word naming and simple L2 (English) word naming. The other group was tested on the same experiment, but with the addition of a condition: if a word denoted an animal, participants were required to push a button as well as pronounce the word. Of the first version of the experiment, it could be argued that an automatic orthography-to-pronunciation link is used in which semantic processing plays a minor role. The second version of the experiment, with the button, tests continuous semantic processing; with each word that appears on the screen, participants are forced to take the meaning of the word into account so as the make a decision about whether or not to press the button.</p> <p>The results of the word naming experiments were analyzed by looking at the variability patterns, to gain insight into the coordination of underlying mental processes. Of interest was the difference between L1 and L2 language processing, and the difference between the simple word naming and the word naming with the heavier semantic component. As hypothesized, the scaling relation found for L1 naming as compared to L2 naming was indeed closer to the scaling relation indicating optimal coordination of mental processes. Surprisingly, the added semantic component was found to affect the patterns of variability of the L1 only. In this paper, we will look at these results and elaborate on why the effect of the semantic manipulation was found for the L1 only.</p>

<p>Communication is a joint activity and interlocutors tend to interactively align with each other's expressions, constructions, pronunciations, etc. In psycholinguistics, the cognitive mechanisms underlying alignment have been described as largely automatic operations facilitating communication (Garrod and Pickering 2009), whereas the socio-psychological mechanisms for reducing linguistic differences between oneself and one's interlocutor are well described in the sociolinguistic context by the literature on accommodation theory (Giles, Coupland, and Coupland 1991). Weatherholtz et al. (2014) suggested that syntactic alignment is to some extent independent of social perception, but factors such as the perception of standardness of the interlocutor, the perceived similarity to the speaker, etc. mediate the degree of alignment. More recently, alignment and its possible implications for learning have also entered second language research (e.g. Atkinson 2010; Trofimovic et al. 2014).</p> <p>The poster focuses on the relevance of social mediation in alignment mechanisms in second language users by contrasting the verbal behaviour of first and second language users in a picture description task that was introduced and accompanied by a speaker whose characteristics of speech varied along two dimensions: use of specific syntactic constructions and speaking either more standard or colloquial German. All participants completed questionnaires on their language learning history – if applicable –, their contact with and use of colloquial German, their perception of the speaker in particular and regional forms of speech in general. The speech data is analysed in the light of this information. Does the social evaluation of the speaker in general as well as the perception of non-standard, i.e. more colloquial ways of speaking, in particular affect the degree of alignment by first and second language users? Do both groups of speakers align in the same way to standard/non-standard-like pronunciation (as measured by /a-/raising) and the usage of specific syntactic constructions? The study aims at further investigating the relevance of alignment on different linguistic levels in second language users, the mediating effects of social and perceptual factors on alignment and their implications for the learning of a second language. Finally, the relevance of alignment in learning and using a language underlines the importance of combining social and cognitive aspects in language sciences in general.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">References:</span></p> <p>Atkinson, Dwight (2010): Extended, Embodied Cognition and Second Language Acquisition.

<p>As a result of the unprecedented spread of English as a foreign language (e.g. Crystal, 2003; Graddol, 2006), language learners and teachers alike are faced with brand new challenges. On the one hand, the global status of English raises questions of social, economic and linguistic inequality (Philipson, 2009) and draws attention to the changing role of local languages. On the other hand, complex multifaceted learner identities (Arnett, 2002; Lamb, 2004) are emerging as elements of the global context intermingle with local realities to create new learning experiences.</p> <p>Therefore, modern approaches to L2 motivation focus on the interactions between learners and the multitude of contexts they participate in (Dörnyei et al. 2015). The quantitative study presented in this paper investigates the influence of global phenomena on university students' motivation to learn English in a particularly local context through the lens of self-guides. It explores interrelationships among key elements of Dörnyei's L2 Motivational Self System (2009) and a number of motivational factors on the one hand, contrasting them against the economic and social background of the Swiss context on the other.</p> <p>The results highlight the significant impact of global as well as local values on university students' self-concepts, attitudes and motivation. In the historically multilingual setting of Geneva (Elmiger & Foster, 2005), plurilingualism represents special values both as an individual asset and a social phenomenon. Preparing for the plunge into the real world of work and responsibility, students at the University of Geneva are particularly aware of these values. Their attitudes are linked, first and foremost, to their sense of obligations, of which proficiency in English forms a part. While the emergence of English threatens Swiss linguistic equality and national identity at a social scale, members of the future active population view the language as a means to an end, an important tool in their plurilingual repertoire.</p> <p>References</p> <p>Arnett, J.

<p>Languages with Default-to-Opposite-Edge stress (conflicting directionality) provide phonologists with intriguing opportunities to investigate the options made available by UG, and have informed all major theories of stress (Hayes 1981, 1995, Prince 1983, Halle & Vergnaud 1987, Idsardi 1992, Kenstowicz 1995, Zoll 1997, among others). I investigate the L2 acquisition of one such language, Khalka Mongolian, where (i) primary stress falls on the rightmost nonfinal heavy syllable (see (1)), (ii) on the final heavy syllable if it is the only heavy syllable (see (2)), or (iii) if there are no heavy syllables, on the leftmost light syllable (see (3)) (Bosson 1964, Walker 1997). Given the additional Nonfinality effect, this is a system even more complicated than other languages displaying conflicting directionality, making Mongolian perhaps the most complex regularly stressed language. Therefore, on the surface, it looks like Mongolian is a Trochaic and Weight-Sensitive language, but a strange one in that End-Rule appears to be sometimes set to Left (1a,b), sometimes to Right (2a,b,d), and sometimes even to Middle (1c,d,f), and sometimes replaced by Leftmost-Wins (3c), a system that is linguistically impossible (see (4-5)), and crucially one that is, thus, ruled out by UG.</p> <p>These problems, however, go away if initial (leftmost) stress in these languages is assumed to be intonational (footless) prominence (Gordon 2000, Özçelik 2014). This would mean that End-Rule is consistently set to Right in Mongolian (with final foot extrametricality), and End-Rule-Right is vacuously satisfied for cases with initial stress, as there is no foot available. However, since producing footless utterances in an L2 is a challenging task for learners with footed L1s (Özçelik 2011) and assuming thus that English-speaking learners of Mongolian will always produce footed outputs, Mongolian L2ers are forced to make UG-unconstrained assumptions, where End-Rule is sometimes set to Right, sometimes to Left and, even more surprisingly, sometimes to Middle (see (4)). However, if interlanguage grammars are constrained by UG, they would produce words that are consistent with either End-Rule-Left or End-Rule-Right only, despite the input.</p> <p>In order to investigate these issues, a semi-controlled production experiment was conducted with English-speaking learners of L2 Mongolian (n=10), of various proficiency levels. The stimuli, composed of 180 words (all nouns), of various syllable structure profiles, were first uttered in isolation, and then in a carrier sentence (see (6)). Only the latter were transcribed and analyzed for acoustic measures (pitch, intensity, duration).</p> <p>The results demonstrate that although the learners did not consistently produce words with target-like stress or intonation, they made various UG-constrained changes to their grammar, such as resetting End-Rule from Right to Left, in order to better accommodate the input (although this is not the value instantiated in the L2 and is different from the L1 setting, too). Crucially, none of the subjects had a Middle or ‘variable' setting for this parameter, i.e. they had it set either to Left or Right. These findings provide evidence for the extension of the Strong UG Hypothesis proposed for L2 morphosyntax (e.g. Schwartz & Sprouse 1996; White 1989) to L2 phonology.</p>

<p>This paper investigates second language (L2) phonological decoding: that is, the production of phonological forms based on their written representations. Various studies have documented the ways in which L1 decoding processes are shaped by the nature of the L1 writing system and, in turn, influence the processing of L2 written forms. This has been interpreted as the automatic triggering of L1-entrenched processing mechanisms by written L2 input, leading to either ‘positive transfer' where the L1 and L2 writing systems overlap or ‘negative transfer' where they differ. It has been postulated that highly congruent L1 and L2 writing system pairs (e.g. English / French) facilitate the L2 learner's task compared to more disparate writing systems (e.g. Chinese / English), because in the former case only minimal ‘retuning' of L1 processing mechanisms is needed. Conversely, it has been argued that highly congruent L1-L2 writing systems may also pose problems for L2 decoders, because the orthographic similarities between the two languages may encourage the triggering of automatic, L1-based processing. This might be expected to be particularly likely in the case of interlingual homographs (e.g. ‘chat', written identically but pronounced differently in French and English). It has been proposed that controlled, strategic processing may allow learners to override such automatic L1-based processing, and thus to decode L2 written forms more accurately. Learners may also be able to achieve some accuracy in decoding written texts (at least those containing few unfamiliar words) by retrieving stored pronunciations of familiar words from long-term memory, providing these stored forms are themselves accurate. To investigate these issues, 32 English-speaking secondary school students, all lower-intermediate learners of French, completed a French reading aloud test comprising 36 decontextualized real words (plus distractors). The words varied on two orthogonal dimensions: (a) half were homographs of English words, and half not; (b) half were familiar to participants, and half unfamiliar. Further, each familiar word was matched with an unfamiliar word with an identical spelling body (e.g. , ‘chair' – , ‘clay'). The pronunciations of the familiar words were additionally elicited using picture prompts. Participants' decoding accuracy was found to be generally low. There were no differences in the decoding accuracy of homographic versus non-homographic words, but participants decoded significantly more familiar words accurately than unfamiliar words, with the latter being more often pronounced in ways which were wholly or partly consistent with English symbol-sound correspondences. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that participants were more likely to decode familiar words by retrieving their stored pronunciations from long-term memory, and unfamiliar words using symbol-sound correspondences at a sub-lexical level. These sub-lexical correspondences were, in turn, heavily influenced by L1 transfer; however, there were also some idiosyncratic pronunciations, perhaps reflecting participants' attempts to move beyond L1 symbol-sound correspondences. Participants' retrieved pronunciations of the familiar words, produced in response to picture prompts, themselves showed some influence of English symbol-sound correspondences, even though no written stimulus was present. Theoretical and pedagogical implications of these findings are discussed. </p>

<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Several studies have focused on the L2 acquisition of Spanish [β ð ɣ] by native English speakers (</span><span style="font-size: medium;">e.g., Zampini, 1994; Face & Menke, 2009)</span><span style="font-size: medium;">; however, no studies have investigated spirantization among native speakers of languages other than English. Moreover, the L3 production of these segments remains unexplored. Accordingly, this study examined the L3 production of [β ð ɣ] by L1 Romanian-L2 English speakers; while Romanian lacks all 3 spirants, English has a fricative similar to the Spanish interdental approximant [ð]. It was predicted that mastery of the English interdental fricative /ð/ may result in a higher rate of spirantization when producing the Spanish interdental [ð], but not bilabial [β] or velar [ɣ], since positive transfer from the L2 into the L3 can occur if a speaker is highly proficient in the L2 (Gut, 2010</span><span style="font-size: medium;">; Llama, Cardoso & Collins, 2010; Wrembel, 2010</span><span style="font-size: medium;">).

Results show that spirantization rates were highest for bilabial [β] (95%), followed by interdental [ð] (58%), and lastly, velar [ɣ] (45%). Although [ð] did not have the highest rate of spirantization of all 3 sounds, regarding the type of spirant produced, the interdental was realized as a fricative more often than as an approximant (32% versus 25%, respectively), while the bilabial [β] and the velar [ɣ] were produced as approximants more often than fricatives ([β]: 31% fricative, 63% approximant; [ɣ]: 20% fricative, 25% approximant). This suggests that mastering the L2 English interdental may result in positive English-based transfer, at least to some degree, </span><span style="font-size: medium;">since as a spirant, [</span><span style="font-size: medium;">ð</span><span style="font-size: medium;">] was a fricative more often than an approximant. </span><span style="font-size: medium;">This study contributes to the growing field of L3 phonological acquisition by investigating the role of cross-linguistic influence in learners' L3 production.</span></span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;"> </span></p> <p><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;">References</span></strong></p> <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Face, T.L., & Menke, M.

<p>German particle verbs pose a special challenge to L2 learners as they appear in different shapes depending on the syntactic context: either with the particle attached to the verb (e.g. abnehmen ‘to lose weight‘, infinitive or dass er abnimmt, 3rd person singular present tense, embedded sentence) or with the particle split from the verb (er nimmt ab, 3rd person singular present tense, V2 context).</p> <p>40 advanced German L2 speakers from various Slavic L1s completed an acceptability judgment (AJT) and a self-paced reading (SPR) task that probed their judgment and processing of 24 German particle verbs. I chose Slavic speakers, as their native languages make frequent use of prefixes, but this prefix is never separated from the verb.</p> <p>In the AJT, participants judged whether a particle verb had been correctly split in a V2 context (1). The SPR task used a 2x2 design manipulating sentence context and split (2,3).</p> <p>(1) V2-context</p> <p>Der Chemiker <strong>*abnimmt/nimmt</strong> die Schutzbrille <strong>ab</strong>.</p> <p>(The chemist takes off the safety googles.)</p> <p>(2) Infinitive context</p> <p>Sebastian soll nochmal fünfzehn Kilo <strong>abnehmen/*nehmen ab</strong> diesen Sommer.</p> <p>(Sebastian should lose another fifteen kilograms this summer.)</p> <p>(3) Embedded context</p> <p>Die Ärztin verordnet, dass Sebastian nochmal fünfzehn Kilo <strong>abnimmt/*nimmt ab</strong> diesen Sommer.</p> <p>(The doctor prescribes, that Sebastian loses another fifteen kilograms this summer.)</p> <p>If the L2 group has fully acquired the syntactic properties of particle verbs, they should judge unsplit particle verbs in V2 contexts as ungrammatical in the AJT and show elevated reading times for sentences in the ungrammatical conditions as compared to the grammatical conditions in the SPR task.</p> <p>No L1/L2 differences were found in the AJT. Both groups judged unsplit verbs as unacceptable. Post-hoc analyses revealed that neither proficiency nor verb frequency were reliable predictors of performance accuracy in the L2 group. An error analysis of the L2 judgments seemed to indicate that for some participants particle verb recognition happens on a by-item basis as the same particle produced very different error patterns for different verbs.</p> <p>I did find L1/L2 differences in the SPR task. The L1 controls showed elevated reading times for ungrammatical sentences in both sentence contexts. An ANOVA run on the residual reading times for the whole L2 group showed that they were not sensitive to the grammaticality violation, only to the context manipulation. Post-hoc analysis using proficiency as a predictor showed an effect only in the embedded condition. Using the results of the offline task to equally divide the group into high and low performers, I found that the high performers showed a pattern that was similar to the L1 controls, while the low performers showed the opposite pattern with faster reading times for the ungrammatical conditions.</p> <p>Taken together, it can be said that sensitivity to the syntactic properties of particle verbs is difficult to acquire even for very advanced L2 speakers, but reaching native-like levels is not entirely impossible. The value of very general proficiency assessments is also questioned as the performance on the AJT was a better predictor of reading time patterns.</p>

<p>In Estonia as in the whole European Union the CEFR is used as the basis for determining second language proficiency. In the CEFR the language levels are described in the "can do" style and these detailed descriptions can be applied to all languages. However, curriculum writers, the authors of study materials, the assessors of language proficiency, the language teachers and learners also need more language specific information about vocabulary, phrases and constructions which are important to communicate successfully on particular levels of the language proficiency. In Estonia the first step in specification of the language levels has been taken: the language level descriptions are compiled and published.There the preliminary description of vocabulary and grammatical constructions essential for expressing language functions and general concepts in different language levels is presented, but it still based more on intuition and experience than on the scientific researches. Therefore there are need for specific scientific researches, which can give useful information for Estonian language practicians and also can develop the understanding SLA in general.</p> <p> </p> <p>In my doctoral thesis I will examine the lexicogrammatical profile of B1 and B2 writing performances in Estonian as a second language, both quantitatively and qualitatively. The study is carried out on a sub-corpora of Estonian Interlanguage Corpus which contains written B1 (27 412 tokens) and B2 level (22 128 tokens) examination papers of Estonian as a second language.</p> <p> </p> <p>The theoretical framework of my research is based on three dimensions of language proficiency: complexity, accuracy and fluency (Housen et al 2012). In addition the DEMfad model (Franceschina, Alanen, Huhta & Martin, 2006) concepts are used: domain, emergence mastery, frequency, accuracy, distribution.</p> <p> </p> <p>The main research questions are:</p> <li>Which lexicogrammatical constructions are typical in the writing performances at B1 level and which at B2 level.</li> <li>How does language proficiency (complexity and accuracy) develop from B1 level to B2 level?</li> <p> </p> <p>In the process of investigation the corpus-driven approach has been used. By using the programm Simple Concordancer two lists has been compiled for both levels (B1 and B2): the vocabulary forms frequency list and the concordances list. The tokens which frequency is 5 and more have been then selected, grouped by morphological forms and compared between B1 and B2 level. I have already found out that one distinguish criteria between levels is use of conditional mood. I have compiled detailed description of using conditional mood in both levels.</p> <p> </p> <p>In next study phases I am going to analyze lexicogrammatical profile of core verbs (tegema 'do, make', tulema 'come', minema 'go', käima 'go, walk', saama 'get, receive“, võtma 'take', andma 'give', panema 'put') and compare results of B1 and B2 levels.<strong></strong></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>References</strong></p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Franceschina, F.; Alanen, R.; Huhta, A.; Martin, M.

<p>While we know that certain segments are more difficult to acquire due to a greater degree of articulatory complexity (e.g., Yavas, 1997; Colantoni & Steele, 2008), no L2 theory can account for this difficulty. This paper aims to contribute to our understanding of the role of articulatory difficulty in L2 acquisition by investigating the production of Spanish by L1 English speakers.</p> <p>Articulatory difficulty (AD) was tested in six native Spanish speakers and six intermediate L1 English, L2 Spanish speakers. Participants were asked to repeat a V.CV sequence (e.g., /oɲo/) at an increasingly rapid rate until they began to produce errors (similar to the Diadochokinetic task that is frequently used in speech sciences, e.g., Yarus & Logan, 2002; Icht & Boaz, 2014). The segment produced with the fastest rate was considered to be the easiest, while the segment produced with the slowest rate was considered to be the most difficult. Each sequence consisted of a vowel ([e, o]) and one of five Spanish segments that do not exist in English ([β, ɣ, χ, ɲ, r]). Two segments that exist in English and Spanish ([m, t]) were also included as a baseline, as stops are expected to be the least difficult (Lindblom & Maddieson, 1988). The 14 V.CV sequences (7 segments in two vocalic contexts) were presented twice to participants in random order. All productions were recorded and subsequently analyzed acoustically in Praat, in order to determine when the productions were no longer target-like.</p> <p>Preliminary results indicate that, as expected, the stops [m, t] were produced with the fastest rates by both groups, signifying that they were the least complex. This is consistent with findings of phonetic constraints (Ohala, 1983; Ohala, 1997) and markedness (Maddieson, 1984). The segments [ɣ] and [x] had the slowest rates of production for the native speakers, and the second slowest rates for the L2 speakers. This suggests that a velar place of articulation is more complex compared to more anterior places of articulation, for native and non-native speakers. Again, this is consistent with phonological theories (e.g. the emergence of the unmarked) that treat coronals as the unmarked segment. Finally, the segment that was the most difficult for the non-native speakers was the trill [r], whereas for the native speakers, the trill had the third fastest rate of production. This was somewhat unexpected, as the trill is considered to have a high degree of AD (due to the precise phonetic conditions required for its production, and the fact that even some native speakers are unable to produce it (Solé, 2002)). Nevertheless, the results indicate that while the trill may be complex for less experienced speakers, it is not necessarily complex for speakers who are accustomed to producing the sound, when they are actively focusing on its successful realization.</p> <p>Overall, these findings provide further evidence that phonetic and phonological constraints play a role in L2 acquisition and reveal that more dialogue between phonetic theories of speech production and L2 speech models is necessary. </p>

<p>In theoretical syntax, prepositional object (to-dative) sentences (PO: S-V-O1-Prep-O2) and double object (DO: S-V-O2-O1) sentences have been widely discussed cross-linguistically. While the general view suggests that PO and DO sentences are different structures used for different contexts (e.g., DO is used for causativity), some ditransitive verbs in English allow both PO and DO structures (e.g., send, give). On the other hand, Turkish PO-DO sentences do not have this difference. Turkish has a DO structure (S-O1-O2-V) marked with Accusative and Dative case. Interestingly, Turkish has free word order; therefore, it allows for the scrambling of two objects, and regardless of the word order, the case marking never changes (PO: S-O1ACC-O2DAT-V, DO: S-O2DAT-O1ACC-V). Therefore, Turkish-English bilinguals can process these structures easily but due to the lack of case marking in English, English DO sentences can be hard to process for Turkish-English bilinguals.</p> <p>Empirically, syntactic priming studies with bilinguals have also focused on PO-DO sentences, and the results show that when primed with a PO or a DO sentence in one of their languages, participants produce the primed structure in their other language. However, this effect is only found when the two languages have the same word order. This is relevant for a particular bilingual group that highly relies on word order - simultaneous interpreters (SI). Simultaneous Interpreting is a cognitively demanding task in which the interpreter has to process two languages at the same time. Since SIs have to be quick and precise, following word order dissimilarities is crucial to perform the task.</p> <p>The current study investigates whether a free word order effect enhances the processing of PO-DO structures between Turkish-English by focusing on Turkish-English late bilinguals, specifically on simultaneous interpretation students in Turkey. The stimuli consisted of Turkish-English sentences containing PO-DO structures. Participants heard two sentences consecutively, either in a match or mismatch condition in English or in Turkish. Participants judged whether the sentences are the same (within-language) or the correct translation of the previous sentence (cross-language).</p> <p>Participants were students of Turkish-English translation and interpreting in Turkey (n=39). Within-Turkish results showed that participants processed PO-DO sentences similarly, meaning that they did not have preferences for PO-DO word order. However, when they had a mismatch condition in Turkish, participants found DO final pairs more similar than PO final ones (p= .009). Within-English test results showed that participants distinguished PO sentences more than DO sentences (p< .001), suggesting that participants recognized prepositionally marked sentences. Moreover, when they heard a mismatch condition cross-linguistically (English first-Turkish second), they again judged DO final pairs to be the correct translation compared to PO final pairs (MD= -9.9, p= .013). These results suggest that participants follow DO word order in Turkish even when they hear a PO structure in English, and they process PO sentences better in English. Further investigation will show why Turkish participants have a DO preference in Turkish, and whether free word order is an advantage or a disadvantage in bilingualism. </p>

<p>In the last decades, research in SLA has discussed a variety of internal and external factors affecting L2 acquisition in the classroom context. With the introduction of inclusive classrooms throughout Europe, learner groups in schools will become increasingly heterogeneous, and, along with this development, L2 instruction will have to respond to the different needs and competences of children in diverse classrooms. While some studies have shown that so-called “at-risk children” benefit from intensive bilingual schooling, other studies in L2 classrooms have produced inconclusive results.</p> <p>This project investigates the impact of internal and external factors on the receptive lexical and grammatical L2 competence by heterogeneous groups of learners in different primary school programs. Such factors include, for instance, specific cognitive skills of the learners, their cultural and socio-economic backgrounds, their language backgrounds including the typological distance between L1, L2 and L3, as well as the intensity and duration of L2 contact and the quality of the linguistic input provided in the L2 classroom. Thus, this paper focuses on the following question:</p> <p>What factors are the most important predictors of L2 learners' receptive lexical and grammatical competence of English in different German primary school programs?</p> <p>The project involves a longitudinal study carried out in 25 primary school classes with differing L2 programs (N=500, t1 in grade 3, t2 in grade 4). Receptive lexical and grammatical English competences are elicited with the BPVS III (Dunn et al. 1997) and the ELIAS Grammar Test II (Kersten et al. n.d.). Nonverbal intelligence, working memory and phonological awareness are assessed using the BUEGA (Esser et al. 2008), the WISC IV (Wechsler 2003), and the P-ITPA (Esser & Wyschkon 2010). The quality of teacher input is monitored with the help of a classroom observation instrument (Schwirz in prep.). Information on the home language background and the socio-economic status is gathered with a parent questionnaire.</p> <p>This paper reports on the pilot study to this project carried out in four German primary classrooms which differ in intensity and onset time of English in the curriculum (participants n=80, age 9;0-10;6). Preliminary statistical analysis suggests that working memory, phonological awareness and the intensity of L2 contact seem to have a strong impact on the learners' receptive L2 skills. Based on previous research we expect the quality of L2 input to have a significant effect on the L2 skills as well.</p> <p> </p> <p>Dunn, L. M., Dunn, L. M., Whetton, C., Burley, J. (1997).

<p>It is a primary objective of the European Commission that multilingual competences receive an emphasis in a globalized world. Early teaching of at least two foreign languages is seen as a priority for Member States in order to promote positive attitudes towards other languages and cultures. Primary students with a migration background exhibit and incorporate these multilingual and multicultural competences in German schools. However, their multilingual abilities are regarded on a cline from being a resource to being an interference in the language learning process by supporters and critics of early foreign language learning in primary schools (Bundesregierung 2007). In addition, research studies on foreign language acquisition of children with a migration background have so far been inconclusive. In order to inform this discussion, further evidence needs to be collected. Therefore, the aim of this study is to compare students learning English as a second or third language and their acquisition of receptive morphosyntactic and lexical skills. In a longitudinal study, approximately 500 young learners will be tested at the end of 3rd grade and at the end of 4th grade. In this group are monolingual German students learning English as an L2 and also multilingual learners of German as an L2 and English as an L3 (n = ca. 100) from different L1 backgrounds. The research questions will be as follows:</p> <p>1. Do mono- and multilingual learners of English differ from each other with regard to their receptive morphosyntactic and lexical skills in German primary schools?</p> <p>2. How do multilingual learners' L2 (German) and L3 (English) develop in their receptive morphosyntactic and lexical skills?</p> <p>This paper presents the pilot study of the project previously described. In the pilot study, the receptive L3 English competences were assessed using the BPVS III (Dunn et al. 1997) and the ELIAS Grammar Test II (Kersten et al. n.d.), receptive L3 German lexical skills were tested with the WWT 6-10 (Glück 2011) and the morphosyntactic skills with the TROG-D (Fox 2006). The initial results of the pilot study show that multilingual learners reach the same proficiency levels in their L3 as monolingual learners. However, the pilot study cannot give any evidence of the development of the multilinguals' L2 and L3; this will be a focus in the longitudinal study.</p> <p>In the workshop, it will be helpful to discuss the focus of the research questions as well as methodological considerations pertaining to data analysis.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>References</strong></p> <p>Die Bundesregierung (2007).

<p>The English nominal suffix -er is known to denote a variety of entities and to cover diverse semantic roles such as agents, instruments, patients, causes, locations, time. In this paper we will not deal with the sources of this multifunctionality but will use deverbal -er nouns to test certain predictions of usage-based models of (second) language (acquisition). We assume that a user's language comprises an inventory of symbolic constructions that emerge from exposure to usage events and differ in the degree of entrenchment and schematicity. We also welcome SLA's recognition that L2 grammar too is emergent, sensitive to input frequencies and that its learning involves categorization, schema extraction and entrenchment, only here in the face of competition from L1.</p> <p>This study aims to identify patterns in the acquisition of the English deverbal suffix -er by advanced Croatian EFL learners that could be explained as effects of entrenchment and type/token frequencies of L2 schemas/forms. Two factors interfere with the learning of -er: L1 influence - none of the Croatian primarily agentive deverbal suffixes are as multifunctional as -er; and L2 influence - different type frequencies of the different -er schemas (agent and instrument schemas are more frequent than locative, cause or patient schemas). Unfortunately, L1 influence is difficult to disentangle from L2 influence; since Croatian breaks away from English roughly where English simmers down to less entrenched schemas (locative, cause, patient meanings are absent from the Croatian suffixal counterparts), we shall refrain from attributing any effects in our learner data to L1 influence (alone). Nevertheless, we performed two experiments to test the following hypothesis and its entailments:</p> <p> Different type frequencies of different -er schemas in L2 affect EFL learners' performance in reception and production tasks. This entails that:</p> <p>a) subjects more readily interpret/produce agent and instrument -er nouns, even if the nouns have lower token frequencies;</p> <p>b) subjects err in the direction of agents or instruments; for lack of a better-suited (more entrenched) categorising schema, they resort to the more entrenched agent/instrument schemas to categorise unknown instances;</p> <p>c) subjects readily recognize and produce the more entrenched instances of the less entrenched schemas, but fare worse with their less entrenched instances. This suggests independent storage of high-frequency instances and weak entrenchment of the locative, cause or patient schema.</p> <p>The experiments were conducted in two groups of Croatian advanced EFL learners (B2-C1). Target -er nouns for test items were selected from deverbal -er nouns obtained from the Corpus of Contemporary American English and then piloted. In the first experiment subjects were asked to define and translate a series of deverbal -er nouns of different semantic types and distractor words. In the second experiment subjects were instructed to provide an English word for an English definition (the targets being deverbal -er nouns). In this paper we present the results of our experiments and discuss their implications for the hypothesis stated above.</p>

<p>The goal of the research presented here is to determine the effects of age of immersion (AoI), manner of acquisition (MoA), bilingual context, and proficiency on how bilinguals (and L2 learners) process language. In this research, bilingual participants were studied to 1) investigate the organization of the bilingual mental lexicon and 2) determine the nature of the interaction between bilingualism and cognitive control.</p> <p>First, the issue of how a bilingual's two lexicons are linked and how bilingual lexical organization is affected by AoI, MoA and proficiency is discussed. This research prompts a number of fundamental questions: are words from a bilingual's different languages organized together in one shared memory system? And, if so, at which level of representation (lexical word-form level or semantic level) are the lexicons integrated? In essence, this research investigates whether English-French bilinguals automatically activate L1 English words (e.g. snow) upon accessing their L2 French translation equivalent (e.g. neige). Second, the issues of how differing levels of cognitive control may affect bilingual processing, as well as how cognitive control in bilinguals may be affected by such factors as AoI, MoA, bilingual context and proficiency will be examined. It is interesting to examine these two issues alongside one another because if bilinguals indeed have a shared memory system for both lexicons, this may increase the need to control the access to the two languages.</p> <p>Our research at the lexical level, which employed the masked priming paradigm (Forster & Davis, 1984), shows that an early AoI is required for the lexicons to become integrated, at least for the native speakers of English with L2 French tested. However, in a preliminary follow-up study looking at native French speakers with L2 English, it appears that even a late AoI can result in integrated lexicons if the MoA is more naturalistic.</p> <p>Previous research on cognitive control in bilinguals has not always shown a bilingual advantage (Costa et al., 2009), and its existence has been debated (Paap & Greenberg, 2013). In our investigations aimed at accounting for the conflicting results found in the literature, we investigated the effects of participant grouping and task difficulty on the Stroop task (which measures cognitive control). While we find no differences between simultaneous and early sequential bilinguals (age groups traditionally both classified as "early" bilinguals) when the task uses only one language, we do find a significant difference between these two groups when the task mixes both languages. We therefore suggest treating the two groups as distinct, and note the importance of the bilingual context.</p> <p>The data collected to date (including earlier studies we conducted at other levels of linguistic processing), indicates that, while AoI is often the most important factor in determining how languages are processed, there is an important role for factors such as MoA and the context of bilingualism.</p>

<p>As all language teachers (and learners) know, no two learners in the same language classroom will acquire identical information or skills. The complex systems or dynamic systems paradigm (van Geert 1991, 2007 and 2010) encourages us to look more closely at the complex interactions between individual learner differences and emerging language knowledge and skill (Verspoor et al. 2013). In a project involving 200 young adults in five European countries, an international team of researchers is currently carrying out a detailed analysis of the first two weeks of a beginning-level Polish course. All learners were absolute beginners in Polish, with no previous experience learning a Slavic language. In addition to filming every lesson (with a microphone for every learner, as well as the teacher), the team took regular measures of emerging Polish knowledge and skill (lexical decision tasks, grammaticality judgment tasks, various comprehension and production tasks). This paper will report on a battery of tests and questionnaires completed by every project participant, administered in order to obtain a snapshot portrait of variables that may come into play in classroom language learning, as well as task execution: attentional capacity (the Flanker Task), working memory capacity (digit span and reverse digit span), personality (the Neo-FFI inventory), metalinguistic awareness (Meara 2005), motivation for learning Polish (in-house questionnaire adapted from Gardner 2004), and “learning style” (as measured by two questionnaires: one adapted from Kolb by Cahay et al. 1997, and Barsch's 1980 Perceptual Preference inventory). Implications of between-group differences in the results on these measures will be explored, as well as a few significant correlations between scores on the measures of individual difference and results on the Polish tasks. Complex Systems Theory warns us that group comparisons are of relatively limited interest, however, and our talk will primarily focus on possible relationships between “outlier” acquisitional pathways (particularly high or low performance on measures of emerging Polish knowledge and skill) and individual characteristics. We hope the talk will stimulate discussion on methods of including learner differences more systematically in the SLA research agenda.</p> <p>Barsch, Jeffrey (1980). Barsch Learning Styles Inventory.

<p>Under the feature-checking approach to code-switching (MacSwan 1999 and subsequent work), the grammatical status of mixed DPs has become a puzzle. Theoretically, in language pairs involving one genderless language, such as English and Spanish, switching between D and N should not be available, contrary to facts. Crucially, the analogical gender (i.e. the gender of the equivalent noun) in mixed DP - such as “la(f) house” - calls into question the architecture of the Lexicon (Halle and Marantz 1994) and consequently the whole process of Borrowing. In fact, analogical gender may be analysed: a) as true concord (among others Liceras et al. 2008), or b) as the output of a lexical rule assigning the analogical gender to the English noun (the “temporary” borrowing account; see Poplack et al. 1982).In this talk we will try to provide an adequate solution to the puzzle by testing the ability of nominal gender to be “infinitely reusable as an ‘active goal'” by the operation Agree (Carstens 2010) in code-switching sentences.We will provide data obtained through judgement grammaticality tasks (JTG) administered to 4 adult Italian-German bilinguals: two L2 learners (German L1) and two adult 2L1, living in Italy. German and Italian are two gendered languages which overtly spell-out gender agreement relations. Our test sentences include the following mixed relative clauses, given in (1-2), and mixed passive clauses, given in (3-4):</p> <p>(1) Der luna, die/den ich gestern gesehen habe</p> <p>“ the moon(mix), which(f/m) I have seen yesterday”</p> <p>(2) La luna, die/den ich gestern gesehen habe</p> <p>“ the moon(f), which(f/m) I have seen yesterday”</p> <p>(3) Der sedia è stata/stato riparata/riparato</p> <p>“the chair(mix) has been(f/m) repaired(f/m)”</p> <p>(4) Der Stuhl è stata/stato riparata/riparato</p> <p>“the chair (m) has been(f/m) repaired(f/m)”</p> <p>In the mixed sentences in (1) and (3), the “active goal” for the operation agree is a mixed DP, while in (2) and (4) a monolingual one, more precisely an Italian DP in (2) and a German DP in (4).The results we obtain from the JTG suggest that the analogical gender cannot simply be analysed in terms of a temporary borrowing. The Italian/German bilingual speakers seem, in fact, to be able to assign the analogical gender even to a monolingual DP. They also accept pattern such as “der(m) luna(f), die(f) ich gestern gesehen habe”, where the Italian feminine noun “luna” (receiving the analogical gender from the German corresponding word “Mond(m)”), values the German relative pronoun as feminine. We also record a difference in judgements between L2 Learners and adults 2L1.</p> <p>References</p> <p>Carsten, V.

<p>Recognition of the contribution of drama to the field of L2 instruction as a compelling approach for enhancing students' oral skills has been growing over the last years. To date, studies into the value of drama in foreign or second language acquisition have mainly been conducted when drama was implemented within the University context (Miccoli 2003, Ryan Scheutz & Colangelo 2004) or as extracurricular activity. However, the need to extend drama to other settings becomes imperative (Beliveau 2013) as well as the need for substantial inclusion of plays in language teaching (Almond 2005, Carroli 2008). On the other hand, the effectiveness of authentic contemporary plays both as texts and as process-oriented full-scale performance in the compulsory high-school curriculum is currently under-researched (Schewe 2013). Additionally, Marini Maio (2012) highlights the lack of quantitative data in terms of the gains made by students who learned through drama-based approaches in their oral skills. Furthermore, no study using drama pedagogy up to date quantified students' achievement on various indicators of measures of Complexity, Accuracy and Fluency (CAF).</p> <p>The present experimental study, which employed a mixed-method approach, has been conducted longitudinally with Italian students in their final year of high-school with a level of proficiency which ranged from intermediate low to advanced low (ACTFL). The experimental group (n=10) was exposed to two interventions conducted over a term each: a text-based approach in the first term followed by a process-oriented full-scale performance in the second term, for a total of 40 lessons lasting 60 minutes each. The research question addressed in this paper is: Within drama-based method, which type of drama promotes Complexity, Accuracy and Fluency better: text-based or performance-based instruction? Quantitative data has been collected through the implementation of an oral pre-test, a mid-test and an immediate post-test by implementing a monologic task: students were required to re-tell the story after reading a self-standing play extract. No time limitation was imposed. Statistical results using SPSS on 1) Global accuracy calculated as percentage of errors per t-unit 2) Subordination complexity calculated as ratio of clauses per As-unit, 3) Breakdown fluency, 4) Speed fluency, 5) Repair fluency and 6) Phonation time ratio achieved and trade-off hypothesis will be discussed. Automatic scripts in PRAAT were used for the analyses of fluency. The findings display dissimilarities in the effectiveness of text-based and performance-based approach to developing various measures of CAF of L2 learners.</p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p> </p>

<p>Dans l'acquisition du français langue seconde (FL2), la maîtrise progressive de la morphologie verbale représente une dimension centrale du processus de grammaticalisation de la production d'apprenants (Klein & Perdue 1997 ; Véronique 2009). Un aspect particulièrement délicat dans l'appropriation de la morphologie verbale est l'acquisition de l'accord sujet-verbe, dont le développement graduel est décrit comme étant lent et long en FL2 (e. a. Nadasi 2001 ; Bartning & Schlyter 2004 ; Howard 2006), ce qui se reflète par la production de formes de base singulières, c'est-à-dire de verbes conjugués à la 3ème personne du singulier, construits auprès d'un sujet pluriel (ex. ils *prend), et ceci même auprès d'apprenants avancés.</p> <p>Un second phénomène essentiel de la présente contribution est l'impact de la complexité, qui sera étudiée comme variable indépendante, facteur favorisant ou ralentissant le processus acquisitionnel d'autres phénomènes linguistiques propres à l'interlangue de l'apprenant L2 (Bulté & Housen 2012).</p> <p> </p> <p>La présente contribution a donc pour but, d'une part, de succinctement décrire le développement de l'accord sujet-verbe à l'oral des apprenants FL2 étudiés, mais surtout, d'évaluer l'influence de la complexité sur le développement de celui-ci. S'inspirant d'hypothèses formulées dans Bartning (1998) et dans Howard (2013), nous étudierons plus particulièrement l'impact de la complexité syntaxique et de la complexité lexicale sur le développement de l'accord sujet-verbe à l'oral en FL2. La contribution permettra ainsi dans un premier temps d'examiner si l'emploi de structures syntaxiques plus complexes entrave en effet le marquage de l'accord verbal avec le sujet. Elle évaluera ensuite l'éventuel impact de la complexité lexicale sur le développement de l'accord sujet-verbe. La richesse lexicale du système verbal des apprenants sera à cet effet mesurée, permettant d'observer à quel point l'adéquation de l'accord verbal est entravée ou stimulée par la richesse croissante du répertoire lexical de l'apprenant FL2.</p> <p> </p> <p>Bartning I.

<p>Incidental language learning has been conceptualized as learning of grammar taking place unintentionally, while learners are focused on meaning of the exchanged messages with their interlocutors and not paying attention to grammatical features – which are nevertheless being acquired (Paradis, 2009; Robinson, 1996). Although incidental learning is sometimes equated with implicit learning, some researchers insist on making a clear distinction between the terms implicit and incidental (e.g. Hulstijn, 2003) reasoning that implicit is be an attribute to the property (for example, implicit knowledge, or implicit memory) which cannot be directly observed, whereas incidental refers to a manner of acquiring knowledge, for example the way of learning something while attention is focused on something else.</p> <p>This paper reports on a study that provided evidence of incidental learning of French past tense forms the passé composé and the imparfait, in three high school classrooms in New Zealand. The learners (n=52) of French FL, age 16, worked on three communicative tasks that involved narrating a story based on a series of pictures. The learners also received implicit corrective feedback, either in the form of recasts or as clarification requests. Having completed the tasks, the learners were asked to answer the questions about their perception of the type of work involved in these three tasks. A randomly selected group of six participants were also required to provide their responses using a stimulated recall protocol after the delayed post-test. Overall, the students' answers suggest that they were not aware they were learning grammar. However, the results of a repeated measures ANOVA and ANCOVA show that the level of accuracy in using both the passé composé and the imparfait in both written and oral production significantly increased from pre-test to post-test. The paper explores the students' perceptions of learning that took place in the classroom and discusses the results of the study in terms of focus-on-form, learner awareness and incidental learning of L2 grammatical forms.</p> <p>Individual differences in analytic ability and working memory were also measured to see what role the cognitive ID factors played in this type of learning. It is assumed that in incidental learning, while processing for meaning and holding semantic representations of the input in working memory, learners must simultaneously assign grammatical structure to these semantic representations, thus in such situations the role of working memory might be more important than the role of analytic ability.</p> <p>References:</p> <p>Hulstijn, J.

<p>Emotions are part of human beings regardless of language, sex, age, or culture, but they are particularly important in adolescence, a period of life characterized by emotional upheavals, search for identity and romantic relationships (Larson, Clore and Wood 1999 ). Emotions are closely related to language and human conceptualization (Altarriba & Bauer 2004; Altarriba 2003; Kövecses 2000; Wierzbicka 1992); yet little has been done to investigate the vocabulary of emotions in adolescents, let alone foreign language learners of this age group. Certainly, there are the pioneering studies carried out by Dewaele 2010; Dewaele & Pavlenko 2002; Pavlenko 2005, 2002; Pavlenko and Diagrina 2007; but these scholars mainly focused on the use of emotion words in narratives by university students, most in second or multilingual language contexts rather than in foreign language contexts. Closely related to emotion vocabulary is the issue of gender as the above studies have shown women's tendency to use more emotion words than men. The present study focuses on adolescent English as Foreign Language (EFL) learners and looks at learners' emotion words in their mental lexicons rather than on their use of words.</p> <p>A total of 21 adolescent (17-18 year-olds) EFL learners took part in this study, designed as a preliminary study within a large-scale investigation on the available emotion vocabulary of EFL learners. By means of a semantic fluency task consisting of two prompts related to emotions, LOVE and HATE, we aimed at getting insights into the learners' lexical output, i.e. first most available words, and semantic clusters. The total number of words retrieved by learners was 450. The preliminary findings showed: (i) a higher number of word responses for LOVE (277) compared to HATE (173); (ii) girls' tendency to outperform boys in the two prompts; (iii) idiosyncratic patterns in first word responses; (iv) common clusters in learners' word responses.</p> <p>The findings are relevant for second language acquisition in what concerns vocabulary retrieval, vocabulary output and the effect of prompt and gender. In the first place, the higher number of words elicited by the prompt LOVE suggests a tendency to focus on positive rather than on negative emotions. In this regard, our results keep resemblance to the ones reported in L2 narrative studies as well as L1 psycholinguistic research. In the second place, learners' first word responses suggest the lack of a common available lexicon in the two prompts examined. Finally, the findings point to the existence of strong cultural beliefs related to the conception of LOVE and HATE held by adolescent EFL learners, although in the case of HATE this influence is weaker; in this respect, the words retrieved by learners in response to HATE remind us of personal stories rather than on common cultural experiences. </p>

<p>Over the last few decades, growing research attention has been devoted to the role of the different types of learning contexts within the field of second language acquisition (SLA). The supposed superiority that is socially attributed to studying abroad (SA) has inspired considerable research focusing exclusively on this learning setting (e.g. Pérez-Vidal, 2014; Dewey, 2004; Freed, 1995). Although the results of most empirical studies to date remain mixed and inconclusive, immersion in the native community appears to substantially intensify the L2 acquisition process, particularly in the domain of speaking skills (DeKeyser, 2007; Segalowitz and Freed, 2004; Valls-Ferrer, 2011). However, SA research to date is scarce in the area of vocabulary. Few studies, to our knowledge, have assessed the development of productive vocabulary after a SA period (Collentine 2004; DeKeyser 1991; Meara 1994; Milton & Meara 1995) and even fewer combined both oral and written linguistic modalities (Pérez-Vidal et al. 2012).</p> <p>Drawing on previous research, the present study attempts to investigate oral and written lexical development during residence abroad by advanced adult EFL learners (N=30). Participants are Spanish/Catalan undergraduates who spend a compulsory 3-month SA period in an English-speaking country, following formal instruction at home. The study focuses on the effect of SA on their lexical accuracy, fluency, diversity and sophistication. To that end, data were collected by means of two elicitation tasks consisting of a semi-guided interview on the subject University Life and a composition on the following topic: Someone who moves to a foreign country should always adopt the customs and way of life of his/her new country. Students' productive vocabulary development was assessed by means of lexical output (types and tokens), lexical diversity (Guiraud's Index, D) and frequency-based measures (Lexical Frequency Profiles) as well as the Greco-Latin or Anglo-Saxon Cognate Indices. Accuracy was measured as the number of grammatical, lexical and pragmatic errors per word under the umbrella measure of the total number of errors per word.</p> <p>Preliminary results indicate that as far as writing is concerned, the amount and types of words produced increase significantly after the SA period. Learners also tend to vary the vocabulary they use, as shown by a significant improvement in lexical diversity. Their lexical errors and total number of errors also decrease significantly over time in both written and oral production. In speaking, in contrast, significant differences are found in some of the frequency-based measures, revealing that learners rely on high-frequency words even after the SA. Our findings suggest that gains in vocabulary, particularly visible in writing, may be related to the task planning factor.</p>

<p>Language learning can be greatly enhanced by activating prior linguistic knowledge and making use of crosslinguistic similarities (e.g. Gibson&Hufeisen, 2003). Multilinguals are known to recognize such similarities more readily, being aided by their well-developed metalinguistic awareness (Jessner, 2006). For a given person using crosslinguistic influences and activating other languages known may depend on typological (Cenoz, 2003) and psychotypological language distance (Kellerman, 1995), proficiency in the languages (Van Hell & Tanner, 2012), and a number of contextual factors, which constitute a set of affordances for that person (Aronin & Singleton, 2013).</p> <p>In the present study we explore the relation between multilinguality and factors responsible for activating prior linguistic knowledge. We investigate how multilingual learners/users of English with various L3-Ln languages (Germanic, and/or Romance), deal with a text in an unknown language. In the study, 40 students with L1 Polish, L2 English (C1/C2) and various proficiency levels in L3-Ln German/Norwegian/French/Spanish were presented with an excerpt from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Danish, a Germanic language unknown to them. In the think-aloud task the learners were asked to translate the text into English. At the same time they had to comment on their associations and mental operations.</p> <p>We grouped the participants according to High/Low Affordance – a cumulative score of typological relatedness, number of languages and proficiency in L3-Ln. We analysed the participant's ability to draw inferences (recognize international words and Danish content and function words), to use top-down strategies (e.g. guessing meaning from context) and bottom-up strategies (analysing grammar and morphology). The analysis showed that the High-Affordance participants recognized significantly more words than the Low-Affordance group. Both groups relied more on top-down than bottom-up strategies.</p> <p>The results of the study reveal that it is proficiency in L3-Ln languages together with cumulative language experience that matters in enhancing the inferencing strategies. Typological proximity of languages helps but only if proficiency in L3-Ln is high enough (here: B1). Our data suggest that metalinguistic awareness needed to tackle challenging language tasks develops alongside with gaining proficiency in L3. It therefore follows that metalinguistic awareness is both a product of multilinguality and a trigger that stimulates additional language acquisition.</p> <p> </p> <p>References</p> <p>Aronin, L. & Singleton, D.

<p>Word recognition is a critical skill in fluent reading (e.g. Hulstijn, 2001). Native speakers of English can recognize single words in about one tenth of a second. Learners are somewhat slower, but this difference is difficult to measure without sensitive equipment. This presentation will provide a brief overview of a new testing tool of high-frequency words that we claim has a useful role to play in L2 vocabulary research with EFL learners. In our approach, words are hidden in nonsense letter strings, and this slows recognition speed to a level that personal computers can easily measure. Learners are assessed on the basis of native speakers' reaction time norms. We will describe the development and validation of this tool and the measurement principles that underlie it. Secondly, we will describe an experiment using the test to investigate learners at different levels of proficiency who were engaged in a full-time English programme, with an explicit vocabulary learning component. The treatment group made significant gains in word recognition scores, whereas a control group which was not involved in the word-learning activity showed no gain in scores. That is, our test appears able to reflect changes in groups, based on proficiency and learning-activity differences.</p> <p>Specifically, the test reflects changes in lexical accessibility, which are weakly linked to general proficiency. The Advanced group made the biggest gain followed in turn by the Intermediate and the Basic group.</p> <p>Further, the evidence for the effect of vocabulary learning on word-recognition ability is not clear. A weak correlation was seen between the reported gains in vocabulary size on the on-line system over nine months and gains in Q_Lex scores (r=0.25).</p> <p>These results do not support the idea that increasingly large vocabulary size leads to better accessibility on the high-frequency vocabulary items. In particular, this result does not match the claims of Laufer and Nation (2001) that a larger vocabulary leads to greater accessibility. However, these results do match the finding by Miralpeix and Meara (2014) that there is no consistent relationship between vocabulary size and accessibility skill. They also claim the relationship is not random, and that also appears to be reflected in our data. The result lends some support to the idea that accessibility might be an independent dimension of vocabulary knowledge.</p> <p>Finally, we will introduce our new online version of this test, and invite attendees to consider exploring it in their own research as a means of gathering further validation of the format.</p> <p> </p> <p align="left">Hulstijn, J.H.

<p>Second language learning has traditionally been associated with acquiring language structures (and other aspects of language) and measured with various means to reveal the learner's increasing level of language development. Success in language learning, however, has been more recently linked to subjective dimensions of language and language learning in an era of globalization – what Kramsch (2009) refers to as the “multilingual subject”. Ortega (2014) emphasized that the likelihood and degree of success in language learning is related to the experience one has with language, and more importantly, that this experience is “at once linguistically, cognitively, and socioculturally constituted” and that it “unfolds in embodied, singular events and practices”. Language learning is thus associated with identity and it is precisely through narratives of singular events that learners may construct various identities. Second language narratives provide insight not only into the language learner's competence in the second language but also into conceptions of the self and the other within a cultural context, as narrators affirm aspects of their own identity and of the identity of others via the presentation and evaluation of behaviors (De Fina 2003).</p> <p>In this presentation, we will discuss identity constructions in adult migrants' narratives involving conceptualizations of language learning and literacy, and the presentation and positioning of self in social experiences related to the adaptation to new languages and cultures. The emphasis will be on how second language speakers employ their linguistic resources in narrative discourse in their identity constructions. The data to be presented come from focus group interviews, or rather conversations, with highly skilled migrants, namely medical doctors, who have come to a European capital. In these conversations, language, language learning and literacy, and the notion of self are recurrent themes. In the presentation, the narratives of two of the doctors will be analyzed – the one doctor from another European country who migrated voluntarily and the other from an African country who came to Europe as a refugee. A particular focus will be on the use of the linguistic resources these second language users employ in the negotiation of identity as categorization, and in their accounting of, and comparing with, their reactions and reflections concerning life before their migration and now in their new homeland. Identity constructions are analyzed as emergent in the narrative discourse through the speakers' use of various lexical resources in categorization strategies. Moreover, metaphors, defined in line with Conceptual Metaphor Theory, are analyzed in their narrative context. Hence the approach employed in the analysis is cognitive as we study metaphors in identity constructions and discourse-analytic as we study the conversational contexts in which identity constructions emerge in interaction. In conclusion, implications for SLA theory will be discussed in light of the “multilingual subject”.</p> <p><strong>References</strong></p> <p>De Fina, A. 2003. Identity in Narrative.

<p>This presentation investigates how near-native speakers (NSSs) of French realize sentential negation, a well-known sociolinguistic variable. Prescriptively, sentential negation in French is accomplished via both the preverbal particle ne and a postverbal negative adverb (most frequently pas), as in (1). In spoken registers, however, preverbal ne is often deleted, as in (2). As Ashby (2001), Gadet (1997), Coveney (2002) and others show, rates of ne-deletion are modulated by a complex interplay of socio-stylistic and formal linguistic factors.</p> <p> (1) Il <strong>ne</strong> vient <strong>pas</strong>.</p> <p> “He is not coming.”</p> <p>(2) Il vient <strong>pas</strong>.</p> <p> “He is not coming.”</p> <p> Because sentential negation varies by register, second language (L2) learners must acquire ne-deletion to render their casual speech stylistically felicitous. Numerous studies have revealed the difficulty of this endeavor. Regan (1996) found that time spent abroad led L2 learners to (felicitously) increase their rates of ne-deletion in casual speech but also (infelicitously) in formal contexts. Sax (2003) also found that exposure to authentic French led to higher L2 rates of ne-deletion. However, compared to native norms, L2 learners still under-used ne-deletion even after several years in France, a pattern mirrored in Sanell's (2007) ‘advanced high' speakers. Howard (2012) is notable for focusing on individual variation, reporting rates of ne-deletion from 39% to 93% across comparable participants. More generally, much research on L2 sociolinguistic competence (Canale & Swain 1980) confirms that L2 speakers - even at very high levels of L2 proficiency- tend to be overly formal (Mougeon et al. 2004), a stylistic infelicity that van Compernolle (2015) labels non-native pragmatic conservatism.</p> <p> The data for this presentation are drawn from a 8.5-hour corpus of 10 informal dyadic conversations between NNSs and native speakers (NSs) of French (of France). In each case, the NNS and NS were close acquaintances and closely matched for age, level of education, and social class, which allows for comparisons of NNS ne-deletion with an ecologically valid NS norm. The data contain 1953 tokens of negation (934 from the NNSs, 1019 from the NSs).</p> <p> Initial coding and analysis reveal that, at the group level, the NNSs' rate of ne-deletion (79.0%) is significantly lower than that of their NS peers (88.6%), χ2 = 32.76, p < .05, consistent with prior studies. However, as in Howard (2012), considerable individual variation arises. Importantly, in 5 of the 10 dyads, the NNS's rate of ne-deletion is statistically indistinguishable from that of the NS. These results are of interest because, although they demonstrate the persistence of non-native pragmatic conservatism at extremely advanced L2 levels, they also show that some NNSs (here, 5 of 10) conform fully to native stylistic norms. The analysis and discussion will also address: (a) the extent to which NNS ne-deletion is influenced by factors known to modulate ne-delation in NS French (e.g., clause type, grammatical person, negative adverb, verb frequency); (b) manipulation of ne-deletion to temporarily shift register; (c) the issue of establishing an appropriate NS norm; and (d) the role of intensity of interaction. <strong></strong></p>

<p>The mental lexicon is an enormously complex cognitive system, and any insights into its organisation will help us to understand the ways in which words are acquired, stored, and retrieved by EFL learners. The lexicon has been likened in the past to various systems of storage and retrieval; nowadays, the metaphor of choice is that of a network, or ‘giant multidimensional cobweb' (Aitchison, 2003).</p> <p>Attempts have been made to formalise the idea of vocabulary networks and determine their properties (see, e.g., Meara, 2009). One promising approach is the use of graph-theoretical techniques to examine semantic relationships between words in the lexicon. Graph theory can be used to represent the lexicon as a network in which words are ‘nodes' and the connections between them are ‘links'.</p> <p>In an exploratory study conducted by the presenters, Gephi (Bastian et al., 2009), a program for large network analysis and visualisation, was used to examine the characteristics of the network generated from an L1 English speaker's word association data (Fraser et al., 2014). The graphs produced by Gephi demonstrated the potential of this software package as a visualisation tool, clearly showing the connectivity of vocabulary items, the position of words within a network, and clustering patterns.</p> <p>The aim of the present study is to replicate the native-speaker experiment in an attempt to answer the following questions:</p> <p>1) How typical are these native-speaker responses?</p> <p>2) How do the network structures of L2 learners at various levels differ from those of native speakers, and what do these differences tell us about the developing lexicon?</p> <p>3) Are there recurring patterns of linkage that can be observed?</p> <p>The subjects, five native Japanese learners of English at different levels of proficiency, and five native English speakers, were asked to produce all possible associations within a set of 100 carefully selected high-frequency stimulus words. The word association dataset was imported into Gephi for analysis, and the resulting network visualisations are presented here. The graphs show clear differences between L1 and L2 speakers' word association and clustering patterns, suggesting that visualising lexical knowledge in this way (i.e., as a large-scale structure) is much more informative than looking at lists of individual words. Our preliminary findings imply that by increasing the number of stimulus words, it may be possible to identify a ‘core lexicon' and important features such as the ‘hubs' that constitute the framework of the developing vocabulary network.</p> <p> </p> <p>References</p> <p>Aitchison, J.

<p>The present study is a preliminary exploration of the role of cognitive factors on the occurrence of crosslinguistic influence or transfer from L2 German in the acquisition of English as a third language. More specifically, the study investigates whether the factors working memory, attention control, or attention switching have any effect on the occurrence of transfer at the levels of lexis (lexical inventions) and syntax (verb placement). The effect of these factors was investigated on data from two different written tasks that differed from each other in terms of their difficulty and of the cognitive load required in order to perform them. The first task was a picture description task based on “The Dog Story” (Muñoz, 2006; xxx and xxx, 2008; xxx, 2014). The second task was an immediate recall task based on Chaplin's silent film “Modern Times”. Learners were asked to listen twice to a 2-minute narrative that explained the first part of Modern Times, while looking at visual stimuli consisting of 3 photographs extracted from the film. Afterwards, they were asked to write it to somebody who had never heard it before. Both tasks were time-controlled, and they were given 10 and 20 minutes, respectively, to carry out each of them. They were administered to a group of 94 Spanish/ Catalan bilingual school-age learners (age range: 10-16 year-olds).</p> <p>The cognitive factors were measured using different tests. A letter span task was used in order to measure the learners' working memory capacity. In turn, parts A and B of the trail making test were employed in order to measure their attention control and attention switching capabilities. Besides these tasks, learners also performed two standardized tests that measured proficiency in the target language (L3 English) and in the source language of influence investigated (L2 German). These were the Oxford Placement Test and the Goethe Placement Test. Even though age was not a factor specifically addressed in the research questions, the sample was split into two age groups (younger vs. older) to avoid any interference of this factor on the data.</p> <p>The raw frequencies of occurrence of the types of transfer under examination were registered in quantitative variables that served as dependent variable in a series of multiple regression statistical tests conducted in each age group and for each task separately. The results suggest that attention control was the most important cognitive factor explaining transfer. Moreover, together with both L2 and L3 proficiency, the model could explain more than 55% of the variance. This, though, was true in the group of older learners. In younger learners the effects of the cognitive factors were overridden by those of age, as these were the learners who transferred to a greatest extent. Likewise, attention switching did not seem to have any effect on the occurrence of transfer, whereas working memory did so only to the extent that it was tested along with attention control.</p> <p> </p>

<p>Opportunities for drawing on implicit mechanisms for learning L2 morphosyntax are limited in the minimal exposure context of primary school classrooms in England. However, the extent to which explicit information and practice is useful for young L2 learners is poorly understood. Previous research shows that practice in making task essential form-meaning mappings is more beneficial than exposure to enriched input (Marsden & Chen, 2011). However, we do not know whether practice in noticing the form (Schmidt's Noticing Hypothesis, N. Ellis's Implicit Tallying Hypothesis), without task essential mapping to function, can be equally effective.</p> <p>The current study investigated the extent to which English learners of L2 German aged 9 to 11 benefitted from explicit instruction on accusative case-marking on masculine definite articles in German. This is problematic for L1 English learners due to a reliance on word order when assigning grammatical roles (as predicted by both MacWhinney's Competition Model and VanPatten's First Noun Principle). Learners tend to misinterpret: 'Den-ACC Opa umarmt der-NOM Mann' as 'the grandfather hugs the man' (Jackson, 2007).</p> <p>The interventions aimed to improve learners' processing of the input by providing explicit information followed by EITHER: Task Essential-Form Meaning Connection (TE-FMC) activities forcing attention on the article and understanding its role-assigning function; OR Task Essential-Form (TE-F) activities forcing attention on the article only ('spot the form').</p> <p>Young learners were randomly assigned to the TE-FMC (n = 45) and TE-F (n = 41) treatments, delivered in 5 x 50 minute weekly sessions. A control group (n = 52) received instruction on lexical items, but no exposure to den. Two untimed written tasks (sentence matching; gap fill) and three one-to-one oral tasks (act out comprehension and production; elicited imitation) were administered as pre- (week 1), post- (week 7), and delayed post-tests (week 16) to assess knowledge of der and den. A metalinguistic task tested learners' verbalisable explicit knowledge.</p> <p>Both the TE-FMC and TE-F interventions resulted in large, significant gains on all measures at post-test. By delayed post-test performance on the outcome measures was maintained, though verbalisable explicit knowledge had deteriorated. No gains were made by the Control group. Principle component analysis suggested that learners in both conditions developed explicit knowledge, available during untimed written tasks, and a different, more proceduralised knowledge type, available under time and communicative pressure. That is, all learners attended to form and function in the input, despite the TE-F intervention making attention to only the form task essential. Analysis of individuals' learning trajectories revealed that group level gains could be accounted for by the performance of a sub-group of learners within each group, demonstrating how individual differences mediate the effectiveness of instruction. The findings extend previous studies (e.g.Marsden & Chen, 2011; Stafford et al, 2012), suggesting that providing explicit information combined with noticing can be equally as effective as providing form-meaning mapping practice.</p> <p> </p> <p>Jackson (2007), Comprehension by L2 learners of German.

<p>Although variationist approaches to linguistics, which examine how language is conditioned by linguistic and social context, were originally applied to the study of language variation and change in native-speaker (NS) speech (e.g., Labov, 1972), this research has been successfully extended to second-language (L2) acquisition (e.g., Preston, 1989; Mougeon, Nadasdi & Rehner, 2010). The application of variationism to second language acquisition (SLA) has enabled linguists to systematically analyze, describe, and explain non-native variation, an undertaking which is essential in order to truly understand how acquisition progresses and what processes are involved (Geeslin, 2011). For example, NSs of French have been shown to be variable in their verb-form use in contexts of future-time reference (e.g., King & Nadasdi, 2003; Poplack & Turpin, 1999), and this variation has been shown to be conditioned by factors such as temporal distance and the presence of a temporal adverbial. Subsequent research on non-native French has indicated that native-like use of the inflectional future, periphrastic future and present in future-time expression, is acquired late, that learners' expression of future-time reference varies, and that this variation is conditioned by some of the same linguistic factors (Howard, 2012; Moses, 2002; Nadasdi et al., 2003). One limitation in most previous studies is the adherence to form-function analyses, narrowly focused on pre-selected forms such as the morphological and periphrastic futures. In this study, we seek to provide a more inclusive investigation of future-time expression in L2 French. In particular, we report a function-form analysis (Bardovi-Harlig, 2007), for which we began by first identifying all future-time contexts before then moving on to an analysis of verb forms used to express future time.</p> <p>The data come from ten spontaneous, informal conversations, each between a highly-advanced English-speaking L2 user of French and a NS of French (20 participants in all). Using a function-form approach, we first examine the conversations (amounting to a total of 77,300 words) in order to determine the full range of verb forms that speakers use to express future time. This examination reveals that the L2 speakers and the NSs use largely the same forms, with some differences in frequency. All future-time reference occurrences (L2, n = 501; NS, n = 445) were coded for a range of linguistic variables whose influence on the selection of verb-form in future-time contexts has been documented in previous literature. An analysis of these variables indicates that the greatest differences between the natives and highly advanced nonnatives concerns the use of the present-for-future. Thus, after discussing the L2 speakers' overall repertoire of future-time forms, we examine in detail the present-for-future, which has received relatively little attention in previous literature, in part because of the form-function bias in favor of investigations looking at morphologically-marked future forms. This examination has implications for future analyses of present forms for future-time expression in L2 French and contributes to theory building in SLA as concerns the acquisition of variable structures more generally.</p>

<p>Recent studies on language learning motivation have foregrounded notions of identity, identification with the L2 community, and self-fulfilment. In his highly influential ‘L2 Motivational Self System', Dörnyei (2005) proposed a view on motivation that distinguishes between an ‘Ideal L2 Self', representing all the attributes a learner would ideally like to possess, and the ‘Ought-to L2 Self', consisting of all attributes that a learner believes he or she ought to possess. Focusing rather on the multilingual experience of the language learner, Kramsch (2006) also highlights the hopes and aspirations of said learner/user, but she conceptualizes these in terms of ‘desire in language', going beyond notions of motivation. Desire in language is said to represent the need to identify (positively or negatively) with others, their language, and their ways of speaking.</p> <p>This paper takes Dörnyei's and Kramsch's theoretical frameworks as points of departure, but it looks at the parents of young language learners, rather than at the learners themselves. Parents make decisions about their children's education, frequently with a view to making their children multilingual. So what hopes, dreams, idealised projections inform this parental ‘desire' to have multilingual children? Or, in Dörnyei's terms, what about the ideal and ought-to L2 ‘selves' that parents project onto their children?</p> <p>In order to explore this line of enquiry, we use data from in-depth interviews about language and identity with 10 parents of various linguistic and social backgrounds in Brussels, Belgium. The participants had all consciously enrolled their children in Dutch-medium education, reputed for its standards in language teaching, even though these parents frequently did not speak the school language(s) (well) themselves. The data reveal that parental choices were not just motivated by a desire to enhance their children's professional opportunities. The parents frequently had vivid mental images of what their multilingual children would achieve in the future (in contrast to their own ‘monolingual' achievements), and what various identity options would be available to their children thanks to this multilingual education. Transcripts therefore show that ‘desire in language' is not limited to the construction of an “inwardly generated identity” (Kramsch 2006: 102); they can also be projected outwardly onto other individuals, in our case by parents onto their children. In the same vein, the data reveal that the constructs of the “Ideal L2 Self” and ‘Ought-to L2 Self' hold up even when they are experienced vicariously.</p> <p>Past studies on bilingualism and bilingual acquisition have frequently acknowledged the importance of parents as an environmental factor in the language acquisition process. However, there is still relatively little SLA research which uses parents as informants and focuses on them as vital stakeholders in the language learning experience. If we wish to deepen our insight into the motivational variables that contribute to language learning and language use, the impact of parental attitudes, aspirations and projections on these variables should be part of the equation.</p> <p>Kramsch, C.

<p>Phraseology (the study of word combinations) is a booming discipline of linguistics, but research on second language learners' representation and processing of word combinations is still scarce. In one theoretical approach to word combinations (Howarth 1996) a phraseological continuum model is assumed where word combinations vary in semantic transparency and restrictedness, from the most transparent category – free combinations – through a semi-transparent category – collocations – to the least transparent category – idioms. To date, the predictions of this model have not been subjected to solid empirical testing, and it is unclear to what extent the postulated categories in this descriptive framework have psycholinguistic validity. In other words, are free combinations, collocations and idioms different in terms of how they are represented and processed? Previous research has indicated that the semi-transparent category of collocations comes with a processing cost compared to the semantically transparent category of free combinations (Gyllstad & Wolter, in press), but idioms have not been tested against those two categories. <br /> To address this gap, an experiment was designed to investigate how second language learners of English process all three word combination types, using verb + noun combinations, and controlling for factors such as word and phrasal frequencies, cognateness and phrasal familiarity. To this end, a semantic judgement task was administered to advanced L1 Swedish learners of English (N = 20), measuring reaction time (RT) and error rates (ER). Employing linear mixed effects modeling, the results show that the less transparent categories of collocation and idiom come with a statistically significant processing cost compared to free combinations in the range of 200 ms (p > .001) , but very little difference was observed when comparing collocations and idioms (not significant). The results also show that the following variables were significant predictors for RTs: verb frequency (p = .002), participants' vocabulary size (p = .007), and participants' phrase familiarity (p = .002). The results seem to indicate that there is not a stair-step fashion in which gradually lower semantic transparency leads to gradually more costly processing, but rather that the most opaque category – idioms – benefits from a marginally quicker, but not statistically significant, processing compared to the semi-transparent category of collocations. This could be due to an idiom superiority effect, stemming from a direct retrieval from a stored whole representation, rather than an on-line computation based on the component parts. This is in line with predictions from dual route models (Van Lancker, 2012). In terms of implications for the phraseological continuum model, the present study provides no evidence for making a clear distinction between collocations and idioms.</p> <p>References</p> <p>Gyllstad, H. & Wolter, B.

<p>Although academic writing has long been a central component of English language courses in Japan many Japanese students still have problems mastering this skill (McFeely , 2002). Early studies in the field of contrastive rhetoric suggested that the cause of this problem stemmed from the fact that the rhetorical structures used in Japanese were very different from those needed to write well in English (Hinds, 1983). However, as researchers have gained a greater understanding of the processes that lead to language transfer they have begun to call this idea into question and the current direction of research has been focused on using students‘ L1 writing knowledge to assist them in their L2 writing activities. (Friedlander, 2005; Conner and Farmer, 2005) Recent research suggests that, with proper knowledge of the rhetorical structures that students are using in their L1 and how these are transferred to the students‘ L2 writing activities, ESL instructors can use their students‘ existing L1 knowledge to scaffold their L2 learning (Cummins, 2000).</p> <p>This presentation will look at the information the presenter has gathered about the organizational patterns found in samples of academic writing, done both in English and Japanese, taken from ESL students studying at universities in Japan over a three year period. First, the presenter will explain the similarities and differences between students‘ L1 and L2 writing and look at some of the difficulties students have with writing in English. The presenter will then look at the the correlation between the students' ability to write well in English and their L1 writing skills. In light of these findings, and using current research in the field of contrastive rhetoric, the presenter will look at how English language teachers can collaborate with their Japanese counterparts to help improve the level of their students' academic writing in both English and Japanese. While the research in question focused on students studying at a Japanese university this presentation will show how these findings would be applicable to students from any discourse community.</p>

<p>Much is known about the intra and extralinguistic reality of the quotative system in native speaker grammars (Canada: Tagliamonte and D'Arcy 2007, Australia: Winter 2002, UK: Haddican et al. 2012), and in L2 or indigenised forms of English (Singapore, Hong Kong: D'Arcy 2013, India: Davydova 2015). But we know very little about the ways in which the rapid the incursion of be like (1c.), which has altered the quotative landscape in the English-speaking world, is acquired and used by EFL learners.</p> <p>1) a. I thought, 'Oh, my goodness!</p> <p> b. If you say, 'Okay, I speak Italian'</p> <p> c. She's like, 'You say like so often. Have you been to America?'</p> <p>Quotation features in educational materials for foreign language learning and they are one of the skills specified in the English language learning curriculum. As Sankoff et al. (1997) note, however, the use of vernacular discourse pragmatic features, such as discourse markers and innovative forms of quotation, is the “hallmark of the fluent speaker” who is fully integrated into the local speech community (consider also Collentine 2004). Our research suggests that innovative, non-standard forms such as be like are acquired in non-educational settings and via exposure to English in naturalistic settings (see Mougeon, Rehner and Nasdasdi 2004).</p> <p>This study aims to investigate the ways in which the quotative innovation is conditioned within the very local Learner English ecology of forms and constraints. We propose to explore the main language-internal and sociolinguistic mechanisms underlying the variable realisation of quotation in a cohort of German learners of English. The data consists of about 800 instances of quotation produced by 45 speakers, all of which are currently completing their bachelors' and masters' degrees at the University of Mannheim.</p> <p>We address the following research questions,</p> <p>(i) Have the German learners of English acquired the quotative variants that are typical for younger native speakers of English? If yes, which system-specific and social factors are shaping the mechanism of variation and is it consistent with what has been reported for native English?</p> <p>(ii) Does the amount / degree of exposure to native speaker Englishes in a naturalistic setting have any effect on the production of innovative be like?</p> <p>This study is concerned with the acquisition of the sociolinguistic variation believed to be “a central part of competence for the native speaker” (Regan 2004: 336). Research on indigenised Englishes has shown extensive “transformation under transfer” (Meyerhoff 2009), where semantic-pragmatic constraints, i.e. quote content, do not get replicated by the non-native speakers (Davydova 2015). Our data suggests that German learners with an extensive record of face-to-face communications with native speakers are adept at picking up on the grammar that governs the quotative system and the innovative be like more specifically. Overall, the study contributes to the discussion of what is possible in the second-language acquisition of the variable grammar (Schleef et al. 2011), while exploring sociolinguistic and cognitive mechanisms that shape the formation of non-native Englishes worldwide.</p>

<p>Production studies have shown that German children master most aspects of verbal morphology at age three (Clahsen, 1986) and of nominal morphology at age five (Mills, 1985; Bewer, 2004). For L2 children, verbal morphology is also acquired relatively quickly (Ahrenholz, 2006), but the full acquisition of the German nominal inflection system has been shown to be a difficult and long process (Wegener, 1995 a). This might in particular due to the semantically intransparent gender system and to the syncretism of many forms. The current study aimed at confirming these observations from production data with an elicited imitation task. In the current study we explored how L1 (n=25) and L2 (n=17) Turkish-German children (mean age=7,3) performed during an elicited imitation test, in which they were presented with both grammatically correct (n=12) and grammatically incorrect items (n=12). The rationale behind it is that comparing learners´ elicited sentences with the original auditory stimulus provides insights into their linguistic competence (Erlam, 2006). Changes of the items during the repetitions, such as the failure to accurately imitate grammatically correct sentences and to normalize grammatically incorrect sentences are considered to mirror participants´ linguistic preferences. In previous studies, participants were observed to change the items in ways that closely resemble their own spontaneous speech (Schimke, 2011; Brown, 1973). Going beyond production data, the inclusion of incorrect items in the imitation task furthermore allows insights into which incorrect items are perceived as so deviant that they are almost always normalized, compared to incorrect items that are repeated even though rarely spontaneously produced. There were four types of items, focusing on two nominal phenomena: 1) case marking/gender agreement of the article 2) adjective inflection and on two verbal ones: 3) word order and 4) subject-verb agreement. Children were asked to listen to the items and to repeat them after having performed a quick drawing task, in order to decrease the probability that they repeated the structures verbatim. The findings reveal significant differences between the L1 and the L2 children during the repetition of the correct items for the two noun phrase categories 1,2) (L1 children= 99%, 97% vs. L2 children=73%, 69%; p < .0001). As for the incorrect items, for the L1 children, there were no high differences among the four conditions. For the L2 children the categories 1,2) were again the major source of errors (they were predominantly not normalized) and were significantly different from the L1 children (L1 children= 75%, 76% vs. L2 children=33%, 33%; p < .0001). Interestingly, the L2-children were more different from the L1 children in their treatment of incorrect than in their treatment of correct items. The discussion of the findings will be based on the kind of errors (that is incorrectly repeated and not normalized sentences) by the two groups for the two categories 1,2), during which the major difficulties have been detected. This analysis allows us to get an overview over the errors and reflect on their nature.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>

<p>Linguistic distance between a known and a new language is often used to predict the difficulty or ease of the acquisition of the new system. Distance can be operationalized as perceived typological proximity (Kellerman, 1979) or via the comparison of linguistic properties of the two systems involved (e.g. Bohnacker, 2006; Jarvis, 2000; Schepens, 2014). In this presentation we tie together the concept of linguistic distance with another classic topic of multiple language learning, Cummins' hypothesis of linguistic interdependence, i.e. the notion that, among other things, literacy skills and resources learned in one language can be brought to bear when learning and using another language.<br />In this paper, the acquisition of German or French by child second language learners whose L1 is Portuguese is investigated. About 200 schoolchildren in either French- or German-speaking Switzerland, i.e. children whose main language of instruction is French or German, are investigated longitudinally over two years (average age at T1: 8;8). Reading, writing and general language skills (C-Tests) are measured three times both in Portuguese and either French or German. <br />The presentation has three related goals: First, our talk addresses the question of how a longitudinal study that focuses on the development of literacy skills can operationalize and statistically model interdependence effects.<br />Second, we give an account of the development of the skills in both L1 and in the two L2s investigated. <br />Third, we attempt to measure the degree of interdependence of L1 and L2 proficiency. We use the notion of interdependence cautiously since the direction and amount of transfer is difficult to assess, as we will discuss in detail. As recent research on other migrant populations shows (Schepens, 2014), the linguistic proximity of the systems is a robust predictor of learnability of the second language. In our data, therefore, we expect the subjects in the French-speaking part of Switzerland to experience fewer difficulties learning the language of instruction than those in the German-speaking part thanks to the closer relatedness between Portuguese and French than between Portuguese and German. By the same token, interdependence effects between the L1 and L2 should be stronger in the French learners than in the German learners. However, the results do not lend unequivocal support to this hypothesis: while the longitudinal cross-linguistic effects are stronger in the French learners (compared to the German learners) for writing skills, this is not the case for either reading or C-test performance.</p> <p><br />Bohnacker, U., 2006.

<p>It is widely accepted that learners exhibit systematic differences based on different L1 and L2 configurations. In closely related languages, due to extensive formal and semantic similarity, the L1 influence is mainly positive. Nevertheless, different patterns in L1 and L2 may cause negative L1 influence as well (Ringbom 2007). According to the structural-contrastive theory, cases in which one L1 phenomenon corresponds to one L2 phenomenon are the easiest to acquire. The most difficult are the L2 phenomena not found in L1, and those in which the L1 phenomenon corresponds to many different L2 counterparts.</p> <p>Although the Estonian and Finnish languages are closely related, the Estonian verb minema ‘go' and Finnish verb mennä ‘go' have developed in different directions. In Finnish two separate and parallel paradigms remain: mennä: menen ‘to go: I go' and lähteä: lähden ‘to start to go, to leave: I start to go, I leave'. In Estonian the two verbs collapse into one paradigm with complementary distribution: minema: lähen ‘to go: I go'. These typologically interesting paradigms are challenging for Estonian learners of Finnish, causing problems both in learning and in use of the second language. The verbs mennä and lähteä thus present a unique opportunity to study the influence of an ambiguity on second language acquisition.</p> <p>The research questions addressed in this study are the following: 1) how and in what contexts do the Estonian learners of Finnish use mennä- and lähteä-verbs, 2) whether and how does the use of lähteä and mennä vary on proficiency levels A2-C1, 3) whether and how does the learner use of lähteä- and mennä-verbs differ from their use in the native corpus. The theoretical framework of the research is based on three dimensions of language proficiency: complexity, accuracy and fluency (Housen, Kuiken 2009) which can be analyzed by DEMfad model (Martin et al 2010). In this study, as in the DEMfad model, the number of lähteä- and mennä-verbs per 1000 tokens of running text is used as an overall measure of fluency. Accuracy is seen as the number of target-like expressions in comparison with native Finnish; distribution is used as a cover term for complexity in traditional sense as well as for variability. To explore the L1 influence, the unified methodological framework of Jarvis (2000: 249-261,) and the Three-Phase Comparative Analysis earlier tested in translation studies (Jantunen 2004) are used. The data is selected from the Estonian subcorpus of the International Corpus of Learner Finnish (ICLFI). Learner language is compared on the native Finnish corpus and on the multi-source-language subcorpus of ICLFI where none of the source languages is dominant, so it can be seen as a source of representative data for learner Finnish in general.</p> <p>I look forward to receiving guidance from the doctoral student workshop on the usefulness of the methodology chosen to my study the influence of an ambiguity on second language acquisition.</p>

<p>Content-and-Language-Integrated-Learning (CLIL) is becoming increasingly established as an approach to teaching both content and an L2, typically English, in European contexts with uptake at all levels of schooling. The coming of age of this approach has given rise to a vibrant research field (see, e.g., Dalton-Puffer 2011 for an overview), but also to need to ask more pertinent questions about the specific benefits of the approach for advanced language learners.</p> <p>One clear advantage in the CLIL language learning process can be seen in the learners' exposure to discipline-specific forms of language and genres, which have been discussed, especially with reference to the subjects History and Science (see, e.g.,Evnitskaya & Morton 2011, Llinares et al. 2010, Morton 2009) Additionally, many accounts of CLIL classrooms (e.g. Dalton-Puffer 2007) suggest higher levels of peer-interaction in CLIL than non-CLIL classrooms, with implications for peer-peer language learning (Philp et al. 2014)</p> <p>One area which has received less attention is the learning of the spoken disciplinary language through CLIL in school education. However, as this type of learning suggests an integration of content and learning to the extent that these two categories can no longer be viewed as separate, its closer investigation seems crucial to an understanding of one of the major potentials in CLIL. Of particular interest is the role of diverse forms of input in that learning, including peer-peer interaction.</p> <p>This paper will present findings from thirty-four 18-year-old learners in an Austrian professional college. Learners were video-recorded during 18 hours of economics lessons over two periods in 2013/14. In addition, two groups of learners were recorded completing a discussion task set by the researchers. Interviews were conducted with teachers on their practices and perceptions of student learning as well as focus group interviews with students on their language uses outside school and the perceptions of their learning processes.</p> <p>This presentation will focus primarily on student-student interactions, both in pairs during class, and in prepared and unprepared group work. The focus lies on oral disciplinary language use, especially of disciplinary phraseology and genre-awareness and –use. Diverse methods of analysis were employed (in line with Philp et al. 2014) which reveal distinct sequential patterns of argumentation within economics and very clear evidence of collaborative, interactive patterns in student discourse.</p> <p>These practices highlight the value of CLIL in preparing learners for the foreign language demands likely to be made on them outside school in their professional lives, and also show the role of peer interaction in the learning of discipline-specific language.</p> <p> </p>

<p align="justify"><a target="_blank"></a> <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">This study aims to determine whether equivalence classification (e.g., Flege, 1995) operates in the same way in second dialect (D2) phonological acquisition in comparison with second language (L2) phonological acquisition. As such, it will investigate assibilated rhotic production of Ecuadorian Spanish by Andalusian Spanish speakers. Although there has been considerable growth in interest in D2 phonological acquisition (e.g., Babel, 2009; Nielson, 2011), not much is known about whether the same mechanisms that are responsible for L2 production also underlie D2 production. Although Ecuadorian Spanish is characterized by assibilated/fricative rhotics (e.g., Lipski, 1994), Andalusian Spanish is mainly characterized by a trill and a tap (e.g., Blecua, 2001). Moreover, it includes sibilants such as [</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">ʃ] </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">as an allophonic variant of the affricates such as [</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">t͡ʃ]</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"> (e.g., Carbonero, 2001). Therefore, based on Flege (1995), similar to English speakers (See Rafat, 2015), assibilated rhotics should be classified as 'similar' sounds and produced as a [</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">ʃ]</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"> or other sibilants. 10 adult Andalusian speakers were asked to do two imitation/repetition task. The participants were tested with real words (30), nonce words (30) and fillers (30) at two different times. The stimuli for the imitation task were recorded by a male speaker of Ecuadorian Spanish. The results were analyzed both auditorily and acoustically. Whereas in Rafat (2015) naïve English-speaking participants mostly produced assibilated rhotics as a [</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">ʃ]</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">, the preliminary results of our study show that 34.25% of the assibilated rhotics were produced as assibilated rhotics, 24.25% as trills, 25% as taps, 13.5% as sibilants and 3% as laterals. Acoustic measurements (e.g., duration, center of gravity, and intensity) of assibilated rhotics produced by Andalusian speakers will also be reported and compared to the characteristics of the assibilated rhotics produced by the male Ecuadorian speaker in the study. In all, the production patterns of Andalusian speakers of Spanish diverge from previously reported L2 production data. We will explain the new findings by considering the phonemic status of [</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">ʃ] (or lack thereof it)</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"> in Spanish and knowledge of the Spanish language. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span><strong>Bibliography</strong></span></span></p> <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span>Babel, M., (2009).

<p>According to the multi-competence concept (Cook 2007) it should be interesting to observe cognitive flexibility and creativity of the L2 user in an instructed learning context instead of comparing the output only with the normative description of the target language in task-based production (Housen et al. 2012).</p> <p>In recent years many researchers have applied the dynamic system framework to SLA research (de Bot et al. 2013; Segalowitz 2010; Larson-Freeman & Cameron 2008) where variability is considered to be the result of systems' flexibility and adaptability to the environment. Among many individual learner variables that have been explored (Dewaele &Wei 2014; Dörnyei & Kormos 2000) the cognitive factor “learner creativity” has been neglected until recently (Albert & Kormos 2011). Based on a dynamic view of language use our aim is to go beyond the description of structural characteristics of languages and investigate some effects of learner's creativity by considering the way they deal with production difficulties as an adaptive and creative process (Kormos 2006).</p> <p>In this study we would like to find out some characteristics of a creative learner in comparison to a less creative learner. We consider lexical innovation in lexical retrieval as an illustration of learner's ability to come up with new solutions, to take risks and to show flexibility, thus as a result of his creativity. Twenty L1 French university students of L2 German with an average level of B2 were shown 30 sets of 2-line drawings and asked to explicit the differences between the two drawings. Based on the criteria of “lexical innovation” we distinguished two groups of learners. We compared their results with respect to accuracy (error analysis), L1 code-switching, control activities observed through self-repair and on-line meta-comments.</p> <p>Our hypothesis is that, when facing difficulties, creative learners will rely more on L2 based strategies (e.g., loan word creation) than on L1 based strategies (code-switching). Moreover, they will use more on-line meta-comments and self-repairs and they will probably produce more errors to maintain creative fluency by using flexibility, imagination and risk taking.</p> <p>Preliminary results show that creative learners use all kinds of possibilities to maintain fluency in oral speech production. They create words in L2 and correlatively use code switches. Indeed, a creative L2 speaker will use all possibilities to maintain communication. </p> <p>They also produce far more meta-comments and self-repair (creative learners are able to correct themselves significantly more) than less creative learners. More creative learners control more and show more productivity which confirms previous results of Albert & Kormos (2011).</p> <p>These first results promote learner creativity as an important variable in the analysis of L2 speech production which therefore must be considered as a dynamic process and cannot be observed only via proficiency tests. Also these results question the role of code-switching which is not always well accepted in instructed learning even though it seems facilitating in language interaction. Further studies could help to better understand the learner's creativity as a part of cognitive flexibility.</p>

<p>Oral fluency is widely used in assessing L2 proficiency, and it is one of the five proficiency dimensions in Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR, Council of Europe, 2007). However, the criteria for assessing fluency are unspecified and rather general. This may be problematic, as all the features of oral fluency may not be as indicative of proficiency level as others. For example, some aspects of pausing may be more related to personal speaking style than L2 proficiency (De Jong et al., 2013). Furthermore, as Ehri (1991) proposes, certain types of errors may even be connected with development of language skills. </p> <p>The current study examines errors based on the limitations of cognitive processing (Segalowitz, 2010) and whether some errors, or disfluencies, may be hypothesized to be to be due to more resources available for language processing. It seeks a detailed analysis of disfluencies in oral tasks, manifested in e.g., trade-off and monitoring own speech (guessing, self-correction). The main question is to see whether different types of disfluencies are more associated with different-level learners and whether some disfluencies could be in fact indicative of development in language skills rather than signs of deficiencies.</p> <p>Participants were Finnish-speaking learners of English as L2, from Grade 4, Grade 8 and Grade 2 in gymnasium (N = 637). Oral fluency was measured in both L1 and L2, in lexical access tasks (rapid naming and word list reading). Different categories of disfuencies were compared to L2 writing proficiency, measured with age-appropriate writing tasks and assessed in CEFR scale. Comparisons were made independently to both different grades and CEFR levels to see whether some disfluencies that are associated with certain proficiency levels, and especially whether some are more connected to more proficient language learners. These results may help to refine the use of oral fluency in L2 assessment.</p> <p> </p> <p>References:</p> <p>Council of Europe (2007).

<p>Over a number of years a lively debate has been taken place on the issue of language proficiency amongst university undergraduates in relation to academic success. As has been shown by a number of studies, language proficiency, particularly academic writing, appears to be significantly related to academic achievement (Bachman 1991; Criper & Davies 1988; Graham 1997; Ferguson & White 1999). Although other factors than language proficiency (e.g. learning style, motivation, aptitude) may contribute as well to lack of academic success, students with inadequate language skills have found to be seriously disadvantaged and hindered. Moreover, significant correlations have been found between language proficiency test scores (e.g. TOEFL or IELTS scores) and first-semester point average (Hill, Storch & Lynch 1999). Research so far, however, has been inconclusive with respect to the minimum level of language proficiency below which students are unlikely to cope with academic study. There is no unanimity, either, with respect to the criteria for judging academic success, the identification and operationalization of relevant components of academic language proficiency, the validity of various proficiency measures and the type of language proficiency test to be used. </p> <p>The present paper investigates the relationship between academic language proficiency, operationalized in terms of academic writing ability, and academic achievement of L2 students. The research was carried out among 419 first-year L2 students of Modern Languages (Arabic, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Scandinavian languages, Slavonic languages and Spanish) at the University of Amsterdam, with Dutch as their mother tongue. All students took part in a diagnostic test of writing skills, in order to assess their academic writing ability in L1. In addition to the writing test, a grammar test was administered. The grammar test measured knowledge of grammatical relations and analysis of sentence structure, in order to establish to what extent grammar scores, for students of Modern Languages, were related to academic achievement. Prior to the tests all participants filled in a background information questionnaire, comprising questions regarding time investment, commitment, motivation for language learning, and grade point average at high school. Academic achievement was operationalized in terms of overall first- and second-semester point average, point average for foreign languages, and student drop-off rates. The following research questions will be addressed in the presentation:</p> <p> </p> <ul> <li>What is the predictive validity of both the diagnostic writing test and the grammar test in relation to academic achievement?</li> <li>To what extent are there any differential effects concerning the predictive validity of the diagnostic writing test and the grammar test, with respect to (i) overall academic achievement and (ii) academic achievement in terms of successful L2 learning? </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>The analysis of the data obtained from the study revealed significant correlations between the scores obtained on both the writing test and the grammar test on the one hand, and academic achievement and second language performance on the other hand. During the presentation the implications of the study with respect to language testing and pedagogy will be discussed.</p>

<p>The motivation for this research is the observation of frequent read-aloud miscues among Japanese university students, and the slow rate of reading on simplified graded readers by many post-secondary learners. Reading in an L2 can be tiring when the writing systems are similar, before considering the effort necessary when they are not. Due to the ‘‘Matthew Effect'' (Stanovich, 1985), whereby people read more if they find it comfortable and less if they do not, a gap opens between more and less able learners. Therefore, we investigated what components of the second-language reading complex may remain undeveloped among Japanese learners. Word recognition in different languages employs different phonological processes; therefore, inadequately developed skill in the second-language reading processes may lead to poor decoding. Indeed, research demonstrates (Coulson, 2014) that Japanese English learners have significantly weaker word reading skills compared to the Korean English learners, whose L1 writing system is alphabetic. The situation regarding Japanese learners requires formal assessment. However, practical tests of word recognition subskills for second-language learners are not widely available. Therefore, we adapted a test from Wydell and Kondo (2003), replicating their methodology to test the phonological skill of a Japanese-English bilingual diagnosed with dyslexia. Copies of our adapted test will be distributed in the presentation.</p> <p>We do not assume dyslexia among Japanese English learners. Rather, the use of this test format aims to elucidate the state of phonological skill of word-recognition ability in ordinary learners. The subjects were university students at discrete proficiency levels.</p> <p>The results show that this skill of phonological manipulation can be remarkably underdeveloped in Japanese L1 English learners. The average skill of subjects with lower proficiency was similar to the objective standard of Wydell and Kondo's English-reading disabled subject. Higher-proficiency subjects performed much better. The results do not necessarily imply dyslexia, although some lower-proficiency students may, in fact, be English-dyslexic. Instead, they primarily focus attention on the lack of appropriate reading skills development in English education in Japan, and its possible effect on overall proficiency. This situation principally indicates a need for prolonged phonics training and more extensive L2 reading.</p> <p>References:</p> <p align="left">Coulson, D. (2014).

<p>The concepts of speech fluency and linguistic proficiency are so closely interconnected that highly proficient biliguals are commonly simply referred to as 'fluent speakers', and that (non-) native-like disfluency patterns are one of the most important predictors of proficiency ratings awarded to L2 speakers (e.g. Dewaele 1996). Fluency in both the L1 and the L2 of bilingual speakers has been a considerable focus of attention in recent years and has been shown to be a complex, multi-level and multi-dimensional construct (e.g. Segalowitz 2010).</p> <p> This paper presents an investiation into fluency phenomena among a corpus of Oral History interviews with German-Jewish refugees. These interviews represent informal interactions which center on the speaker's biography and foster unmonitored, naturalistic speech in which hesitation markers are used most naturally. We investigate the phenomena of breakdown (silent pauses > 250ms), speed (speech rate) and repair in these interviews in both the L1 (German, n=76) and the L2 (English, n=102) of speakers who had left Germany in 1938 and 1939, aged between 7 and 17 years, and lived in English-speaking countries for upwards of 50 years.</p> <p> Based on the information provided in these interviews, we assess the impact of extralinguistic and biographical factors, such as education and language use, on the development of the disfluency patterns in both languages. The results reveal a complex interaction of these predictors.</p>

<p>So far, the research in the area of learner language has focused predominantly on English as the target language (Paquot, 2014; Granger, 2013; Pravec, 2002) . However, with the rise of China as a global power, Chinese as a major world language has become an increasingly popular foreign language. As a result, the number of L2 Chinese learners is growing rapidly (e.g. Dube, 2009). Yet, the specific challenges that learning Chinese presents still remain to be systematically investigated. In this context, a learner corpus can provide the much needed systematic and robust evidence about the process of L2 Chinese acquisition and help both researchers and L2 practitioners.</p> <p> </p> <p>This poster presents Guangwai Lancaster Chinese Learner Corpus, a one-million-word corpus of learner Mandarin Chinese, which is a result of the cooperation between the Guandong University of Foreign Studies and Lancaster University. The corpus has both a spoken (400,000 tokens) and a written (600,000 tokens) part and covers a variety of task types: The written corpus data range from essays under test conditions to free compositions; the spoken corpus data consist of structured oral tests and free conversations. In terms of the interaction, the corpus includes both dialogues and monologic tasks. The corpus covers three broadly defined proficiency levels: beginner, intermediate and advanced and includes speakers from 72 different countries (L1 and cultural backgrounds).</p> <p> </p> <p>The poster focuses on the following areas:</p> <p> </p> <ul> <li>Corpus design and methodology</li> <li>The nature of spoken and written L2 Chinese</li> <li>Error coding (different levels: grammatical, lexical, collocational etc.)</li> <li>Availability and release of the data</li> </ul>

<p>Complexity, Accuracy, and Fluency (CAF) are three dimensions along which L2 writing and speaking are frequently assessed (Housen, Kuiken, & Vedder, 2012). Trade-off effects along the three dimensions have been empirically demonstrated, especially with regard to changes over time (Robinson, 2001; Skehan, 2009). However, the exact nature of these interactions is subject to debate. Robinson's (2001) Cognition Hypothesis assumes that Complexity and Accuracy grow together, while Fluency suffers. Also Skehan's (2009) Trade-off Hypothesis expects a growth of two dimensions at the expense of the third, but opposes Robinson in predicting that Complexity and Accuracy will never grow together. Additionally, it is unclear whether these proposed interaction effects also hold for advanced bilingual speakers.</p> <p>The current study therefore analyzes a corpus of interviews of German L2 English speakers (n=99) and L1 German attriters (n=73) who have been living in an English-speaking environment for the majority of their lives. For each CAF dimension, multiple measures were generated. The scores were z-transformed and log-transformed where necessary. Additionally, composite scores were calculated for Complexity, Accuracy, and Fluency. Using mixed-effects linear regressions, we then investigated 1) the effect of one Complexity, Accuracy, and Fluency measure on the others and 2) the effect of one composite Complexity, Accuracy, and Fluency measure on the other composite measures.</p> <p>Preliminary results indicate an overall positive relationship between accuracy and complexity, i.e. the more accurate the productions, the more complex. Fluency appears to remain unaffected being neither positively or negatively related to accuracy and complexity. At the level of individual measures we find e.g., the higher the lexical diversity (complexity), the fewer the total number of errors per 100 words. The results will be discussed in the light of Robinson's Cognition Hypothesis and Skehan's Trade-off Hypothesis.</p> <p>Housen, A., Kuiken, F., & Vedder, I. (2012).

<p>The academic year at an Irish university is divided into periods of highly intensive study (in our case, twenty-four teaching weeks, and seven weeks devoted to revision and sitting exams), followed by long periods of holidays (four weeks in December/January, and sixteen weeks from the end of May to the middle of September). These long periods away from formal teaching are generally viewed positively, since they provide students with an opportunity to travel and undertake practical work experience, thus continuing their education in a broader sense and building their CVs.</p> <p>However, from a pedagogical point of view, such periods also entail risks, in particular in ab initio language learning, when the proficiency level reached at the end of the first year of instruction may arguably still be too low for some students to withstand substantial attrition. In dynamic conceptualisations of language development (e.g. the Dynamic Model of Multilingualism, Herdina & Jessner, 2002), both the potential speed of development of the language system, and the system's resilience to attrition are thought to depend on learners passing critical proficiency thresholds. Furthermore, both also depend on the amount of language maintenance effort (LME) and indeed language acquisition effort (LAE) a learner is willing or able to expend. It is precisely the absence of such effort over the summer break, combined with a relatively low proficiency level that may lead to students returning to university with heavily diminished language skills.</p> <p>This paper draws on a longitudinal study of foreign language writing development in a cohort of students of Russian. It compares the learners' written productions at the end of their first year (after 132 contact hours) with those after the summer break along selected CAF dimensions, and relates the findings to measures students took in order to keep or develop their proficiency level. These measures include travelling to and/or attending a language course in a Russian-speaking area, revising material before the start of the second year, studying to take repeat exams etc., and are in turn influenced by motivational factors as well as practical choices and opportunities. The paper asks how effective the chosen measures were in counteracting language skill attrition over the summer break.</p> <p>Herdina, P., & Jessner, U. (2002). A Dynamic Model of Multilingualism.

<p>The acquisition of liaison in spoken French has been studied intensely in the field of psycholinguistics over the last 15 years. However, many developmental aspects of this phonological phenomenon, especially in L2 learners, call for further research. There is for example little consensus in the literature regarding the driving forces behind the acquisition of French liaison. Should it be explained as a gradual automatisation of a morphophonological rule or as the result of lexical learning of individual chunks (Wauquier & Shoemaker, 2013)? In a recent study, Howard (2013) underlines that, in order to better understand the developmental aspects of liaison in L2 French, more research is needed, especially in learners at lower proficiency levels and from different types of tasks.</p> <p>This paper presents data from a cross-sectional study exploring the production of liaison between a subject pronoun and a verb in third person plural, as exemplified in (1). This is an obligatory liaison context which has rarely been investigated in previous studies.</p> <p>(1) Ils arrivent à la fête /ilzaʀivalafεt/ ‘they arrive at the party' </p> <p>The participants are instructed Swedish L2 learners of French (n=40) ranging from level A1 to C1 on the CEFR-scale (European Council, 2001). The learners, as well as 20 native speakers in a control group, conducted an elicited imitation task, including both high and low frequency verbs as well as non-verbs, in order to investigate the influence of proficiency level and input frequency on the use of obligatory liaison as an agreement marker in L2 French.</p> <p>The results indicate great difficulties in production of liaison in subject-verb agreement at lower levels of L2 French. As in other agreement patterns, learners over-use the singular form */ilaʀiv/ in contexts for the plural /ilzaʀiv/ (Prévost, 2009). However, the development is strong and a clear effect of proficiency level was found on the use of liaison in the imitation task (p<0.001). Moreover, no frequency effects could be observed in this study (p.=0.82). This means that the L2 learners used liaison to the same extent with all tested verbs, irrespective of their objective frequency. This result nourishes the theoretical discussion of the field since it could bring into question a usage-based approach to the acquisition of obligatory liaison in L2 French.</p> <p><strong>References</strong></p> <p>Council of Europe (2001).

<p>It has been suggested that crosslinguistic influence is relevant even in simultaneous bilinguals acquiring two languages that differ with respect to a particular parameter. Hulk & Müller (2000) and Müller & Hulk (2001) propose that crosslinguistic influence occurs at the interface level between syntax and pragmatics, when the syntactical structures of two languages of the bilingual partially overlaps. Recent studies (e.g., Sorace & Serratrice, 2009; Sorace et al. 2009; Serratrice et al. 2012) have found crosslinguistics interference in contexts, which involve two typologically similar languages. For example, in a study examining the production of overt and null pronoun in English-Italian and Spanish-Italian bilinguals, Sorace et al. (2009) found that not only English- Italian, but also Spanish-Italian bilinguals preferred overt pronouns even where null pronouns would have been a more felicitous choice, underlining the need for further research in this area.</p> <p> </p> <p>This study reports on acceptability judgment (AJ) and translation task data from 10 simultaneous Turkish-Italian bilinguals (mean age 9,5). The linguistic property investigated is postverbal subjects occurring with unaccusative verbs. Both Italian and Turkish are null subject languages. Subject inversion is accepted as one of the property for null subject languages (Rizzi 1982, Jaeggli & Safir 1989). Although both Turkish and Italian allow post verbal subjects with unaccusative verbs, this position is regulated by different discourse requirements in the two languages: in Italian the postverbal subject position with unaccusative verbs is favored in neutral contexts (a) (Pinto, 1997), while in Turkish postverbal subjects can only be used as background information (b) (Erguvanlı, 1984). </p> <p> </p> <p>(a) A: É affondata una nave</p> <p> sink-PST-3RD a ship-SBJ</p> <p> ‘A ship sank'</p> <p> </p> <p>(b) A: O gemiye ne oldu?</p> <p> That ship-DAT what happen-PST-3RD?</p> <p> B: Battı o gemi. </p> <p> sink-PST-3RD that ship-SBJ</p> <p> ‘That ship sank'</p> <p> </p> <p>Besides the bilingual children and the age-matched Turkish and Italian monolinguals participated the study as the control group. The results of the AJ task in Turkish revealed no significant difference between monolingual and bilinguals. However, in the Italian AJ task, significant variability was found among the groups but only in contexts involving less frequent unaccusative verbs. Translation task involving 10 sentences was administered only to the bilingual group. In translation from Italian to Turkish, the children always produced pragmatically appropriate sentences. When translating from Turkish into Italian, the children were sensitive to the position of the subject in the Turkish stimulus: children produced translated sentences in Italian reproducing Turkish word order even if this word order was not pragmatically appropriated.</p> <p> </p> <p>Those results support previous findings (e.g., Sorace & Serratrice, 2009; Sorace et al. 2009; Serratrice et al. 2012) in that interference at the interface occurs also with languages sharing the same parametric setting, Effects of task type, presenting different degree of processing load, need further consideration and discussion.</p>

<p>Selection of copular verbs in Spanish (ser/estar ‘to be') is a classic challenging area for L2 learners. Most of the studies have concluded that estar is more problematic than ser, particularly with adjectives (Bruhn de Garavito & Valenzuela, 2006; Geeslin, 2002; 2003; Schmitt & Miller, 2007; among others); yet, very few studies looked at the acquisition of location, with the exception of Sera (1992), Pérez-Leroux, Álvarez & Battersby (2010), Dussias, Contemori & Román (2014), and Perpiñán (2014, 2015). Generally speaking, these studies showed that L2 speakers of Spanish have difficulty expressing location of events, which requires ser; whereas location of objects, which requires estar, is acquired earlier. Still, none of these studies looked at the semantic interpretation of the choice of copular verbs in locative constructions, and its developmental stages of acquisition.</p> <p>The present study investigates the production and comprehension of locatives with ser and estar in English-speaking learners of L2 Spanish (n = 36) with a low-intermediate proficiency as determined by the DELE. In a Picture Matching Task, participants had to choose between pairs of pictures according to the meaning of the sentence provided as in La cena es/está en la sala (Dinner is on the living-room.). Crucially, the nominals employed could have a double interpretation—as an event (the act of having dinner) or as an object (the food)—and the use of the verb—ser or estar—disambiguated the meaning. There were 6 pairs of pictures, with two interpretations each (one with ser and one with estar), a total of 12 target responses plus 12 distracters. In an Elicited Production Task, participants were presented with a map of a city to locate a list of objects or events (k = 8), such as la cita (the date) or las palomitas (popcorn).</p> <p>Results indicated that low-intermediate level English-speaking learners of Spanish have weak intuitions about the semantic entailment of the ser/estar distinction in locatives. Accuracy responses were higher for events with ser (56% correct) than for objects with estar (40% correct). In the production task, we found similar results: correct use of ser with events was higher (60%) than the location of objects with estar (42%).</p> <p>These results in low-intermediate learners show a different pattern than the previous findings for the acquisition of copulas with locatives, which reported that the acquisition of events with ser was more challenging than the acquisition of objects with estar. However, we do not believe that our results go against previous findings; instead, we interpret these higher accuracy responses with ser and events not as the complete acquisition of the copular alternation in locative contexts, but as instances of the general delayed acquisition of estar, as proposed by VanPatten (2010). In the initial developmental stage depicted here, estar is underused for location and ser is overgeneralized; as a result, higher accuracy is found with location of events than with objects. Finally, these results show that the process to master the semantic differences that the two copulas entail is problematic also in locative contexts.</p>

<p>Grammatical gender is one of the most challenging features for second language acquisition, since it requires the online integration of an unpredictable lexical property of the noun on the one hand and morphological agreement on the other. This paper reports the findings from an EEG investigation of grammatical gender in German, contrasting bilingual and monolingual processing. In order to examine whether variability in the processing of gender violations by bilingual speakers can be ascribed to the more complex task of managing two linguistic systems (bilingualism effect) on the one hand or to the order of acquisition, modulated by biographical factos such as age at onset (second language effect), we will compare four populations: advanced second language learners with different native languages (all L1s are typologically distant from German, some of them do and some of them do not encode gender grammatically) who began acquiring German between the ages of 4 and 32 (L2ers, n = 108), native speakers of German who have lived in an English-speaking setting for upwards of 7 years and were aged 20 years or older when they emigrated (L1 attriters, n=26) and predominantly monolingual German controls.</p> <p> We present the results from an EEG experiment in which 96 German sentences were auditorily presented to assess responses to gender violations on highly frequent masculine and neuter nouns. 48 sentences contained determiner-noun combinations and 48 determiner-adjective noun combinations. Pairings of grammatical-ungrammatical sentences were created by swapping the masculine and neuter determiners. The experiment also contained 48 sentences testing a different grammatical construction (verb agreement) and 134 filler sentences, so that the overall proportion of correct sentences was 74.1%.</p> <p> While the EEG responses of the German attriters show no significant difference from those of the controls and both populations have strong and reliable responses to Det-Noun and Det-Adj-Noun violations (P600), the results from the L2 groups exhibit a more varied pattern which is modulated by the structure (Det-N vs. Det-Adj-N), the linguistic background (+gender or –gender language), proficiency in L2 German and the age of acquisition. We discuss these findings in the context of hypotheses of representational deficits in L2 acquisition vs. theories of crosslinguistic interference.</p>

<p>Even though many people nowadays spend one or more periods of their adult lives immersed in a second-language (L2) environment, not much is known about the underlying mechanisms of natural second language acquisition. One of the challenges in researching this is finding the right balance between naturalness of conversation and experimental control. This paper presents a novel method for investigating natural L2 word learning and some preliminary findings.</p> <p> German learners of Dutch were invited to participate in a study ostensibly about making price judgements. They thought the study was open to anyone who could speak Dutch, including Dutch people themselves. The study consisted of two parts. In the first part (the pre-test), participants were asked to sort pictures of familiar objects according to price, and afterwards presented their ranking to the experimenter out loud. In this way, it became apparent which objects they did and did not know the name of. This allowed for an individualised item and filler selection for every participant.</p> <p> In the second part of the study, the participant and the experimenter took turns comparing two objects in price. Exactly 24 objects whose name had been found to be unknown in the sorting task were always rated and named by the experimenter first, but would at a later point appear in the participant's trials, and have to be named by him/her. This showed whether or not the word had been learnt. Because of the refined cover story, participants were completely naive with regard to taking part in a vocabulary learning study.</p> <p> The study was intended to investigate whether natural word learning takes place at all under these implicit circumstances, and whether learning rates are sensitive to three factors that are expected to affect memory performance. The first of these factors was cognate status: are non-identical cognates (for example: schort – Schürze, English apron) acquired more easily than non-cognates? The second and third factor were number of exposures and time between exposure and testing: are words learnt better after having heard them four rather than two times, and are they retained better after a short rather than a long lag?</p> <p> A preliminary look at the data reveals that natural word learning indeed takes place, although post-test performance had declined relative to immediately after learning. Furthermore, the data suggest that all factors exert the expected influence. This provides us with a method for implicit vocabulary learning that is sensitive to factors commonly known to affect memory performance under explicit learning conditions. The method can be used in the future to investigate the role of other factors in natural L2 word learning, such as ‘nativeness' (do people more readily learn from a native than a non-native conversational partner?), attention (does learning improve when attention is drawn to the unknown items?) and proficiency (do advanced learners learn new words more easily?).</p>

<p>This study investigates how the languages in a Spanish-English-French contact situation interact in structuring the Adjectival Noun Phrase (NP) in French as an L3+. The research focuses on the examination of convergence between syntactic and lexical Cross-linguistic Interaction (CLI).</p> <p>Transfer in Second Language Acquisition (SLA) may be regarded as a language contact phenomenon (Treffers-Daller 2009) which may be accounted for through models developed in code-switching (CS) research (Myeres-Scotton 2002). The structure underlying Interlanguage (IL) can be depicted as a Composite Matrix Language (CML). CML is defined as an abstract grammatical frame structured by the Target Language (TL), the developing IL, the L1 and L2s (Jake 1998, Wei 2009). This perspective on IL is advantageous as it provides a holistic approach to the study of CLI in SLA, particularly regarding typologically related languages that may overlap syntactically and lexically.</p> <p>Qualitative data was elicited from 8 Spanish L1 informants (2 at Initial State, 2 at Post-Initial State, 2 at Intermediate State, 2 at Lower-Advanced State of acquisition of French L3+) and 3 English L1 informants (1 at Post-Initial State, 1 at Intermediate State, 1 at Lower-Advanced State of acquisition of French L3+) residing in the UK. Informants completed a language profile questionnaire, which established language use and perceived typological distance, and three speaking tasks (informal interview, picture description task focusing on colour adjectives, and sentence formation task). The CML Model (Jake 1998) was used as an analytical tool to examine Adjectival NP structures concurrently with the analysis of Lexical CLI using typologies developed in the fields of CS and SLA.</p> <p>Results indicate that for the two L1 Spanish informants at the L3+ French Initial State the Adjectival NP predominantly displays a structure that suggests syntactic CLI from English. This type of structure was occasionally observed in the Adjectival NP of the remaining L1 Spanish informants. Conversely English did not appear to structure the Adjectival NP of L1 English informants suggesting that the formation of IL is not exclusively determined by the structures of the source systems, and that other factors are involved such as language status and language use.</p> <p>Further qualitative analysis indicates that the language that frames the IL at the level of the Adjectival NP is not automatically the source of lexical CLI. Lexical CLI from Spanish can be accompanied by an “English-like” structure, while lexical CLI from English can occur within an “English-like” structure and a target-like structure. This suggests that lexical and syntactic CLI are separate phenomena and that lexical CLI do not automatically trigger syntactic CLI.</p> <p> </p> <p>Jake, J. L. (1998).

<p>Afin d'encoder la localisation statique et dynamique, l'apprenant francophone du suédois L2 doit acquérir la sémantique complexe des verbes de position (stå « être debout », ligga « être couché », sitta « être assis » pour la localisation statique ; ställa « mettre debout », lägga « coucher », sätta « asseoir » pour la localisation dynamique), ainsi que la répartition discursive des informations spatiales, différente de celle du français. En effet, le français et le suédois appartiennent à deux typologies différentes, à savoir langue à cadrage verbal pour le français et langue à satellite pour le suédois (Talmy, 2000). Nos résultats (Hellerstedt, 2013) montrent que les apprenants L2 utilisent les verbes de position de façon croissante avec un usage proche de celui de la langue cible par les apprenants avancés. A partir de l'ordre d'acquisition établi dans notre étude (ibid.), les apprenants L2 (de niveaux intermédiaire et avancé) développent plusieurs stratégies afin de résoudre les problèmes qui surgissent lors de la communication. Parmi ces stratégies, l'une consiste en la sur-utilisation de l'un des verbes requis pour encoder la situation spatiale. En effet, ces apprenants choisissent généralement d'employer ceux encodant l'horizontalité (à savoir ligga/lägga), dans le but, semble-t-il, de les utiliser comme des verbes de localisation et de placement généraux au début de l'acquisition. Or, cette sur-utilisation est souvent réalisée au détriment d'un autre verbe, surtout le verbe exprimant quant à lui la verticalité (à savoir stå/ställa). En outre, ces mêmes apprenants L2 sous-utilisent de façon générale les verbes de position statique en faveur d'un verbe existentiel, voire d'une ellipse. Notre communication sera l'occasion de discuter les raisons derrière ces stratégies.</p> <p> </p> <p>Hellerstedt, M. 2013. L'utilisation et l'acquisition des verbes de position en suédois L1 et L2.

<p>As written multiple-choice tests are commonly used to gauge knowledge, investigations into test-taking knowledge and approaches are highly desirable, particularly in SLA contexts where they are examined much less compared to L1 settings.</p> <p>This paper comprises a series of case studies of two monolingual (L1 American English), two early bilinguals (L1 Greek-L2 American English), and two late bilinguals (L1 Japanese-L2 English), and their performance on a test of written receptive vocabulary knowledge. This study sought to: 1. complement the existing body of quantitative data on vocabulary assessment; 2. employ a “labour-intensive method of testing” to ensure meaningful results (Nation, 2012, p. 10); 3. gauge the determination of word knowledge of monolingual, early bilingual, and late bilingual test-takers; 4. compare their test-taking approaches.</p> <p>Participants individually took the 100-item Vocabulary Size Test (VST) (Nation & Beglar, 2007). The VST was followed by a structured, immediately retrospective word-knowledge and test-taking interview (adapted from Nagy, Herman, & Anderson, 1985). Each interview was transcribed and coded by the interviewer using provisional coding (Miles & Huberman, 1994).</p> <p>The results of the study found that test takers, regardless of L1, language proficiency, or age of acquisition, utilized the same test-taking approaches and determination of test answers and in similar proportions (with respect to their total vocabulary size):</p> <p>1. <strong>Knowledge-informed (K) answer</strong>: Test-takers were familiar with the target word.</p> <p>2. <strong>Partial knowledge-informed (PK) answer</strong>: Test-takers had knowledge of the target word, but this knowledge was not sufficient to satisfy condition #1.</p> <p>3. <strong>Test strategy-informed (TS) answer</strong>: Test-takers had knowledge of a non-target word, a distractor, or item stem. </p> <p>4. <strong>Informed (IG) guess</strong>: Test-takers possessed knowledge and/or test strategy, but it was insufficient to satisfy condition #1, 2, or 3.</p> <p>5. <strong>Non-informed (NG) guess</strong>: Test-takers lacked knowledge and/or were unable to apply test strategy to the item.</p> <p>Based on the results of this paper, a qualitative interview checklist that can be utilized alongside multiple-choice assessments for larger n-sizes will be presented.</p> <p>Since monolingual L1 English and both early and late bilingual users of English show similar test-taking patterns and in similar proportions, it would be worth investigating bilingual learners of other languages, and to identify how their results might impact SLA instruction and assessment as a whole.</p> <p><strong>References</strong></p> <p>Miles, M.

<p>In an era of internationalisation, triggering increased multilingualism, Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) provides an interesting alternative to traditional education for the acquisition of an additional language. A new interdisciplinary research project entitled ‘Assessing CLIL' has just been launched and aims to tackle the interplay between linguistic, cognitive and educational aspects of the CLIL approach in French-speaking Belgium. Despite abundant literature indicating higher proficiency in the target language for CLIL learners (Admiraal et al. 2006, Dalton-Puffer 2011, Lasagabaster 2008), it largely remains unclear to what extent, in what respect and thanks to which (internal and external) processes/factors CLIL learners outperform traditional learners.</p> <p>The present study is part of this evaluation project and focuses on socio-affective variables. While it is established that language attitudes and motivation play a significant role in language learning (see amongst others Gardner 1985, Dörnyei 2003 and, for Belgium, Mettewie 2004), this study wishes to investigate the attitudinal profiles and motivational processes in CLIL, including the possible impact of different target languages (Dutch and English in this case) and individual variables, compared to non-CLIL contexts. The aim is to isolate and/or integrate into a model, socio-affective variables both as outcomes of the specific language learning and contact situation CLIL and as predictors of linguistic and cognitive variables. Our hypotheses are that CLIL contexts might not only affect language attitudes, but also enhance self-efficacy and perceived task value (Wentzel & Wigfield 2009) and, as such, influence cognitive, linguistic, and socio-cultural outcomes.</p> <p>These hypotheses will be tested through three types of data collection within a longitudinal design, comparing CLIL-pupils in Dutch or English in the last two years of primary and secondary education with equivalent non-CLIL pupils. The first data type consists of a large quantitative background and socio-affective questionnaire, which will be administered at the beginning and end of the overall data collection. In the mean time, complementary qualitative data will be collected through focus group sessions, tackling pupils' language use, intergroup contacts, attitudes, motivation, emotions and perceptions about the teaching/learning experience in CLIL/non-CLIL. Finally, qualitative and quantitative data will be contrasted with classroom observations in an attempt to capture the role of socio-affective variables within the teaching/learning process in situ.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>References</strong></p> <p>Admiraal, W., Westhoff, G., & de Bot, K.

<p>It is an undisputed fact that one of the key factors in successful second language acquisition is learning – and storing – new words. And yet researching how vocabulary acquisition takes place is one of the most difficult endeavors in the field of second language acquisition. Cook points out that it is straightforward to test how many L2 words a learner knows, but far harder to know how these items were actually acquired (2012).</p> <p>From L1 learning, we have known for some time that native speakers can “fast map” sounds to meanings: in less than 14 minutes of passive listening to new words, neural response patterns emerge that mirror responses triggered by existing words. This has been taken as evidence for words rapidly becoming consolidated in memory (Shtyrov, Nikulin & Pulvermüller, 2010). The seminal work by Gareth Gaskell and colleagues (Davis & Gaskell, 2009; Gaskell & Dumay, 2003) provides further insight into the consolidation process: rapidly formed word memories do not attain the same status as established words, which are all highly connected in the mental lexicon. Instead, they are subserved by distinct neural substrates. It is not until a post-learning consolidation period, typically involving one night's sleep, that novel words acquire word-like properties and are fully integrated into the existing lexicon. The most convincing evidence for this lexicalization process stems from new words competing with their lexical neighbors after the consolidation period, witnessed in longer response latencies to existing words similar in form (see also Bakker et al, 2014). It has been suggested that the speed of lexicalization also depends on how many languages a person knows (Bakker et al., 2014). And yet, the question if this consolidation period works similarly in second language learners has not yet been directly investigated.</p> <p>This paper reports an L2 word learning and consolidation study that uses Gaskell & Dumay's (2003) design and nonsense word list, but rather than native speakers of English applies it to 30 English majors (whose L1 is Dutch), all in the second and third year of their BA program. In other words, these subjects are advanced learners of L2 English. These subjects have currently all been recruited and are being tested (last subjects scheduled to be tested on 10th April 2015). The tentative outcomes seem to suggest a similar pattern of lexicalization as has earlier been found for L1 acquisition, but will be presented in full at the EUROSLA meeting. These outcomes can inform L2 theorizing on how vocabulary is acquired and stored.</p>

<p>Grammatical meaning, which involves a range of linguistic domains including discourse, semantics, syntax, and prosody, is currently an important focus in theory-driven research into second/foreign language (L2) acquisition. Findings include evidence that the ease or difficulty of acquisition of a given property of the target language may depend on the linguistic domains involved in that property. For example, phenomena that involve the interface between syntax and discourse, (such as when to use and when to omit subjects in Spanish) are often acquired only by the most advanced learners, if at all, whereas phenomena involving the integration of syntax and semantics are more readily acquirable, though not unproblematic (e.g., Serratrice et al 2009; Slabakova 2008; Sorace 2005; Sorace & Filiaci 2006; a.o.). It is only recently that attempts have been made to begin to articulate such findings beyond the field of generative linguistics (e.g., Whong, Gil & Marsden 2013), and their potential benefits in terms of approaches to the language classroom have not yet been widely explored. Likewise, insights from the language classroom are rarely incorporated into linguistic research, even though the language classroom provides input that shapes classroom learners' knowledge of meaning in their L2.</p> <p>This colloquium brings together research where advances have been made — despite the prevailing trend — in bridging the gap between formal linguistic L2 acquisition research and the practice of language teaching. The colloquium addresses the following question:</p> <p>How can theoretical SLA findings on meaning be exploited in the language classroom?</p> <p>Four papers are included, and each addresses this question by focusing on a different grammatical meaning phenomenon in L2 acquisition. Paper 1 is an intervention study that investigates the effect of providing instruction and practice on the grammatical meanings of articles in L2 English; Paper 2 compares textbook instruction on the English quantifier any with L2 English learners' behaviour on any, and argues for a role for instruction about semantic negation in textbooks; Paper 3 investigates object pronoun clitics in L2 French, and proposes that French teachers of English-speaking learners could benefit from understanding that their difficulty lies in a semantic mismatch between the French clitics and English pronouns; Paper 4 looks at L2 acquisition of the linear order of adjectives in English, which follows from a meaning-based hierarchy of adjective types. It compares L2 English learners who received explicit instruction about adjective order with learners who went on an English study abroad programme but did not receive instruction on adjective order, to find out whether instruction or immersion facilitates lasting development in this domain. Each paper is allotted 20 minutes within the colloquium with an additional 5 minutes for questions. The remaining 20 minutes are divided into a 5 minute introduction to the colloquium, and a 15-minute discussion, led by an invited discussant.</p>

<p>The proposed thematic colloquium comprises 4 papers on second language acquisition that are driven by a number of recent insights from language typology. Our work draws on different areas of language typology, both semantic (the typology of motion and causation events) and syntactic (word order typology). We first present a model of SLA grounded in the idea that language is a complex adaptive system and that acquiring a second language can be successfully studied if the relevant mechanisms of such as system are properly understood. The proposed model CASP (Complex Adaptive System Principles) based on an extensive electronic corpus of L2 English learner data, enables us to explain and predict when, why and how typological similarities and differences will interact in second language acquisition, sometimes resulting in transfer (positive or negative) and sometimes not. We use examples from typologically different L1 languages (e.g. Chinese, French, Japanese, Spanish) in order to illustrate how CASP works. In the second presentation we show how typological differences can affect second language use in a study that reveals the influence of the L1 on memory for causation events while speaking L2. The third paper in this session is a discussion of the ways in which inter- and intra-typological differences between three different L1s (French, German and Italian) and Spanish as a common L2 affect learners' acquisition of deictic motion expressions. Finally, our fourth presentation focuses on the effects of different pedagogical approaches to bilingual L1 language instruction that (English/Spanish or Catalan) children receive in a specific multilingual environment (Catalonia, Spain) and we explain how the variability in their instruction results in variable degrees of both successful L1 acquisition and L1 attrition. In this way, the colloquium highlights areas of second language and bilingual research where linguistic typology provides important theoretical insights that are then tested empirically using different methodologies and different datasets, as illustrated in the colloquium presentations. Finally, we contextualise our discussion within the broader implications of this research for our understanding of both language-specific and more general language processing factors that play a role in second language acquisition. </p>

<p>In Usage-Based Approaches of language, frequency in the input is regarded as one of the most important factors of language development (see for instance Ellis, 2013 and Goldberg, 2006). Yet, there still is a lot unknown when it comes to input frequencies, because this factor has long been neglected in Second Language Acquisition (SLA) research. Furthermore, it is usually quite complicated to investigate the role of input on the learners output. Second Language (L2) Learners often have diverse backgrounds and receive different types and amounts of input. It is therefore not straightforward to study the role of the input in natural second language development in a SLA context. Sometimes artificial languages have been used as an attempt to overcome these problems, but those have indisputable restrictions. <br> In this study, I propose (following Dimroth, Rast, Starren and Watorek, 2013) that beginning Foreign Language learners that are learning a language completely unknown to them at that point, form an interesting group to study the relationship between input and output. Firstly, the learning setting is a controlled setting. Secondly, due to the fact that learners have no prior knowledge and no or little contact with the language outside the classroom, the input they receive is surveyable. <br> In the current case study I looked at verb constructions in written input and output of 51 beginning native Dutch speaking learners of Swedish as a Foreign Language in Belgium. I compared the written input during the first 12 weeks of language development to the written assignments they produced during that same period. During data analysis, the focus was on complex predicates. It will be shown that there are frequency effects on both form and meaning in the output, but that other factors, such as saliency and form-to-function mapping may also play an important role.</p><p> </p><p>Dimroth, C., Rast, R., Starren, M. and Watorek, M.

<p>This study further investigates whether Meara's (2005) LLAMA tests are reliable for use in aptitude testing. The LLAMA tests were designed as shorter, free, language-neutral tests that are loosely based on the MLAT tests (Carroll & Sapon 1959). They contain four sub-components testing vocabulary acquisition, implicit learning, sound-symbol correspondence and grammatical inferencing. Since development they have been used in over 45 research projects including several PhD theses. This is of some concern to Meara (p.c.) as they have not been validated. Previous studies by Graneña (2013) and Authors (2014) have provided some initial results relating to the validity of these tests. This study further examines three questions that have arisen from the results of these previous studies.</p> <p> </p> <li>Are the LLAMA tests language neutral?</li> <li>What is the effect of age on LLAMA test scores</li> <li>What is the effect of bilingualism on LLAMA test scores?</li> <p> </p> <p>Authors (2014) had a small sample size for the first research question (n=14) and grouped Arabic and Chinese native speakers together as a non-Roman script group. This study separates these groups. These results will be compared with matched second language learners from a roman script background. Each group contains over 30 participants.</p> <p> </p> <p>The LLAMA tests were not originally designed for use with children. As the question of aptitude and age has been contested in the literature (e.g. Abrahamsson & Hyltenstam 2008, Muñoz 2014), it seems appropriate to investigate the use of these tests with younger populations. To address this second research question, we will examine the test results of 4 groups of 30 learners. Group 1 contains 9-10 year olds, Group 2 contains 14-15 year olds, Group 3 contains 18-21 year olds and group 4 contains adults over the age of 40. These age groups were chosen to examine a range of ages including both younger and older participants who are long past any possible critical period.</p> <p> </p> <p>The third research question arises from previous research suggesting that aptitude can be trained (e.g. Grigorenko et al, 2000; McLaughlin, 1990; Sternberg, 2002) or changed due to experience, (e.g. Kormos, 2013; Sáfár & Kormos, 2008; Sawyer, 1992; Sparks, Ganschow, Fluharty & Little, 1995; Thompson, 2013). Authors (2014) did not find any significant differences in a post-hoc analysis of reported language experience. However, this did not take into account the level of language proficiency. This study specifically targets bilinguals (two L1s before age 5) and advanced L2 learners. Each group contains over 30 participants and will be compared to matched monolingual controls.</p> <p> </p> <p>Data collection is ongoing with over 100 participants already tested and a further minimum of 80 scheduled. This study aims to provide a further step in the validation of Meara's (2005) LLAMA tests by testing much larger numbers and targeting some of the questions that have arisen from previous studies.</p>

<p>With the growing interest in the research into L2 learners' cognitive processes in SLA, especially the role of learners' attention and awareness in second language learning, stimulated recall has been applied as an introspective measure into many empirical studies. However, only a few SLA studies have addressed the issue of reactivity when using this methodology (Adams, 2003; Egi, 2007; Egi, 2008) and the results have showed an uncertain role of stimulated recall as far as the reactivity issue is concerned. Moreover, since many studies (e.g. Egi, 2007; Egi, 2008; Mackey, Philp, Egi, Fujii, & Tatsumi, 2002; Mackey, 2006) conducted stimulated recall after the completion of all the treatment sessions and posttests to detect learners' awareness, the validity and veridicality of stimulated recall have been questioned due to the time-delay of the recall interview. The present study will attempt to investigate the effectiveness of immediate stimulated recall after each treatment session and before posttest and explore whether verbalization in the immediate stimulated recall interview affect learners' subsequent task performance.</p> <p> </p> <p>The study followed a traditional pretest-treatment-posttests procedure. There were 48 participants randomly assigned into two groups, i.e., the immediate stimulated recall group (n=24) and the control group (n=24). Both groups were asked to complete the same sets of interactive tasks during each treatment session with interlocutors' frequent recasts of English past tense provided in their interactional feedback. While the control group had three treatment sessions and complete tasks with interlocutors, the participants in the immediate stimulated recall group were asked to recall their thoughts immediately after they completed each treatment session by watching the video of their performance in the treatment.

<p>Researchers have shown that in human communication, gestures and speech are tightly integrated at the phonological (i.e., temporal), and semanticopragmatic levels (e.g., McNeill, 1992). Beat gestures are a type of rhythmic hand and arm movements that have been shown to be tightly interconnected with speech prominence (McNeill, 1992). Researchers have shown that speakers use auditory and visual marking of prominence to selectively encode and update discourse information and thus facilitate comprehension and recall. </p> <p>In the field of second language acquisition, most studies have focused on the positive role of representational gestures on L2 vocabulary learning (e.g., Kelly et al., 2009). However, the potential beneficial effects of beat gestures lack solid investigation. Yet, beat gestures have been shown to aid in the recall of native words in both adults (So et al., 2012) and children (Igualada et al., 2014). Previous studies in the L2 field have brought into focus the fact that L2 learners use beat gestures profusely in situations of lack of recall (Gullberg, 1998). Yet to our knowledge, only one study has examined the role of beat gestures on word learning at the phonological level. Hirata et al. (2014) detected a moderate positive impact of hand syllabic-rhythmic beat gestures on auditory learning of phonemic vowel length contrasts in Japanese.</p> <p>Our study aims at assessing the potential effects of prosodic (e.g., focal pitch accents) and visual (e.g., beat gesture) prominence on L2 novel vocabulary acquisition. Participants will be presented with lists of L2 words in one of the following four conditions: 1) accompanied by no prominent prosody and no gesture; 2) with marked prosody but no gestures; 3) accompanied by beat gestures but by unmarked prosody; 4) accompanied by prominent prosody and beat gestures (“natural beats” condition). We will use an adaptation of So et al. (2012). We expect a positive effect of naturally-produced prosodically prominent beat gestures on novel L2 vocabulary memorization.</p> <p> </p> <p>References:</p> <p>Hirata, Y., Kelly, S., Huang, J., & Manansala, M.

<p>Evidence suggests that bilingualism can affect verbal and nonverbal cognitive performance across the lifespan. In verbal tasks bilinguals are usually outperformed by monolinguals, but in nonverbal cognitive tasks depending on executive control bilinguals often outperform monolinguals. Elderly speakers are associated with both reduced lexical access and a decrease in executive control. This leads to interactions between bilingualism and aging.</p> <p>Our study investigates effects of bilingualism on linguistic performance and on executive control functions. Because of expected interactions between bilingualism and aging, we compare the performance of middle-aged and elderly participants. We also investigate the Interaction Hypothesis (Bialystok, 2009), which proposes that bilinguals' conflict between competing language systems results in both a reduction of lexical access and a boost of executive control functions playing a part in language processing. Additionally, we aim to investigate whether a potential bilingual cognitive advantage extends to bilinguals who acquired proficiency in their second language (L2) after puberty as well.</p> <p>Linguistic and general cognitive performance are tested in an experiment involving 52 German functional monolinguals, 52 Dutch/Frisian early bilinguals, and 52 Dutch/German late bilinguals, equally divided over two age-groups, i.e. of 35-56 and 65-85 years old. All participants perform a verbal fluency task testing controlled, rapid language production, a cued task switching test and a working memory test. What this study adds to earlier research in this field is that its design enables us to analyse the interaction between performance on verbal and nonverbal cognitive tasks, in groups of participants speaking highly similar languages.</p> <p>The results of the nonverbal cognitive tasks confirm earlier findings in which early bilinguals outperformed monolinguals, and we also found a bilingual advantage for the late bilingual group. There was an age-related increase both in overall reaction times, indicating lower processing speed in the elderly, and in the size of the switch and the mix effect. However, both bilingual groups were less affected by an age-related increase in switching costs than the monolinguals, suggesting an attenuation by bilingualism of the age-related decrease of the efficiency of executive control functions.</p> <p>Unlike what was found in earlier studies, in the verbal task early bilinguals were not outperformed by the monolinguals. In the phonological verbal fluency task, early bilinguals even scored higher than the monolinguals. We also found significant correlations between results on the verbal and nonverbal tasks, suggesting that similar mechanisms are responsible for bilingual effects on nonverbal and verbal cognitive functioning.</p> <p>Finally, this paper will have a special focus on the performance of the late bilingual group. Since this group showed more diversity in language background and L2 proficiency than the other groups, we logged details concerning their language background in a questionnaire and tested their L2 proficiency in a word recognition test. We will here present the outcomes of analyses within this late bilingual group of the effect of the variables L2 proficiency, age of onset of bilingualism and duration of bilingualism on the efficiency of executive control.</p>

<p>As recently acknowledged, the field of SLA has tended to privilege the oral mode over writing in theory, research, and in the language classroom (Byrnes & Manchón, 2014; Ortega, 2012; Williams, 2012). Such neglect of written language learning may clearly compromise the comprehensiveness and ecological validity of SLA theories, constructs, and research outcomes. It would therefore be advisable for SLA research to include both oral and written modalities in future research agendas, pursuing, at the same time, a more nuanced understanding of modality effects in terms of the kind of L2 production they induce, and the distinct opportunities for L2 development they generate (see contributions to Byrnes & Manchón, 2014).</p> <p>This gap in previous research has recently started to be addressed in several strands of SLA-oriented research that have focused on the potential of L2 writing for language learning. One of these strands, partly framed in the TBLT framework, has focused on task-modality effects (cf. see Ellis & Yuan, 2005; Kormos, 2014; Tavakoli, 2014). The present paper is an attempt to add to the this body of reseach with an exploration of (i) how language mode (written versus oral) influences learners´ task performance, and (ii) whether the effects of cognitive task complexity are constrained by mode (Kuiken & Vedder, 2011; Tavakoli, 2014). In the experiment, N=78 L1 Spanish/Catalan EFL learners performed orally and in writing the simple and the complex versions of a problem-solving task ( „fire-chief“ task from Gilabert, 2009). With task complexity as a within-learner factor and mode as a between-learner factor, we analyzed L2 oral and written production using a range of traditional CAF measures and also employing such measures as idea units, whose analysis makes possible to assess propositional complexity – a subdimension of complexity which has been rarely explored in SLA research (Bulté & Housen, 2012; Ellis & Barkhuizen, 2005).</p> <p>As regards our first research question, the analysis showed that writers exhibited higher linguistic and propositional complexity and spent more time on task than speakers. On the other hand, speakers had less lexical errors and were more fluent than writers (all p < 0.5). Concerning the impact of task complexity on L2 oral versus L2 written production, our findings revealed that written production was affected by increases in task complexity to a greater extent than speech, especially in the areas of accuracy and fluency. While the patterns of the results for linguistic complexity were largely similar in the two modes, it was the area of propositional complexity where the increases in the cognitive load played out differently, affecting quantity of idea units in speech and the type (i.e, quality) of idea units in writing. Findings are interpreted in light of the cognitive SLA theories (e.g, Focus-on-form research, Output hypothesis), cognitive-interactionist theories of task-based performance (Robinson, 2001, 2011; Skehan, 1996), and recent theoretical proposals of the language learning potential of L2 writing (cf. Byrnes & Manchón, 2014; Manchón, 2011; Ortega, 2012; Williams, 2012).</p>

<p>In the area of Second language acquisition (SLA), subordination is often linked to complexity (see for instance Norris & Ortega, 2009). Only at late stages of development, language learners are assumed to learn relations between clauses and structures that go across clause boundaries. Although subordination ratio is commonly used as a measure for complexity, this has recently been criticized (Norris & Ortega, 2009; Bulté & Housen 2012; Baten & Håkansson, 2015). Baten & Håkansson (2015) for example, argue that not subordination ratio is important in analysing language development, but rather the internal structure of subordinate clauses. In the current paper it will be suggested that it should also be taken into account that subordination and coordination are often presented as two strictly binary phenomena, even though typologists have shown that they can be seen as more gradual phenomena or as a continuum (see for instance Lehmann 1988, Croft 2001, Givón 2001, Cristofaro 2003). The aim of this study is to analyze subordination as a more gradual phenomenon in the development of language learners, by investigating various types of subordination in the broadest sense. The study is carried out within the framework of Construction Grammar. <br /> In this case-study, longitudinal data from 25 Dutch speaking learners of Swedish as a Foreign Language are analyzed, starting from absolute beginners level. The data consists of free written assignments that are obtained at eight different points in time, over a time span of 1,5 years. In these texts, the use of coordinate clauses, various types of subordinate clauses and various structures in between, such as infinitival complement clauses and pseudo-coordination are examined. Based on the data, it is shown that subordination ratio indeed is too superficial a measure to determine complexity or learner development. The type of subordination and the semantic and syntactic bond between and within clauses and phrases are also important to take into account in order to arrive at a more nuanced view of complexity and learner development. </p> <p><strong>References</strong></p> <p>Baten, K., & Håkansson, G. 2015.

<p>The role of dictionary use in developing vocabulary knowledge in a second language has been researched extensively (e.g. Nation, 2001; Tono, 2001). While several different factors such as type of dictionary, type of vocabulary and type of learner have been investigated, the majority of studies have concentrated on reading comprehension. Very little is known about the role of dictionaries in developing listening comprehension and speaking.</p> <p> Sign language dictionaries offer a unique possibility to explore this issue. Since sign languages lack an established written form, learners use sign language dictionaries mainly to look up vocabulary for direct sign production (the equivalent of the ‘speaking' skill). Online sign language dictionaries typically represent signs in the form of a video and provide information about their meaning through one or more glosses in the learners' L1. These L1 glosses, however, are often at best only partially equivalent to the sign (Duval, 2008). This paper seeks to establish what role sign language dictionaries play in vocabulary learning and whether the current dictionary format is problematic for adult L2 sign language learners in encoding and decoding.</p> <p> I report here on two studies that form part of a larger PhD project examining the addition of L1 definitions to sign language dictionaries. Firstly, a think aloud study was carried out with 12 users of a sign language dictionary (the Online Dictionary of New Zealand Sign Language). This study showed differences in lookup patterns between learners of different sign language proficiency levels. All users experienced problems in looking up unknown signs by sign form. Learners in classes used the dictionary most regularly and also ‘browsed' the dictionary to develop their vocabulary knowledge. Many learners repeatedly looked up already known signs for production rehearsal.</p> <p> Secondly, an online error correction test was administered to two classes of intermediate learners of New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL). Learners were directed to look at the online dictionary entry for target signs before evaluating whether the target sign was used correctly in a sentence, and indicating and correcting any errors. Test results indicate that in many cases, the dictionary information did not help learners spot incorrect use of a sign.</p> <p> Taken together, these studies show that the role sign language dictionaries play in vocabulary learning may currently be limited to increasing rehearsal opportunities and developing depth of knowledge. Learners encounter problems when they look to the dictionary for assistance in the comprehension and production of sign vocabulary in context. While some of these problems are inherent in dictionary use, others may be solved by changes to the content and format of online sign language dictionaries.</p> <p><strong>References</strong></p> <p>Duval, A.

<p>The investigation of L2 fluency in recent decades has brought increasing rigour and understanding of its complex nature and role within the broad sense of L2 acquisition (Freed et al., 2004; Kormos, 2011). Nevertheless, L2 fluency remains difficult to define and measure consistently, particularly across the two dimensions of cognitive and utterance fluency (Segalowitz, 2010). There is, we argue, a separation of methods between these two dimensions, effectively creating a distinction between linguistic and temporal fluency research. Linguistic fluency studies, e.g. using CLAN, tend to focus on changes across a mix of measures, including morphosyntactic accuracy and lexical diversity, using both monologic and interactional tasks. Temporal fluency studies, e.g. using PRAAT, tend to focus on more fine-grained changes in speech rate and breakdown to reflect automaticity in utterance production, usually measured in monologic speech. The two dimensions clearly overlap in many aspects, but studies which specifically focus on combining both are rare, despite their value in understanding fluency in a more holistic way. This is particularly true for L2 Mandarin, currently under-researched in SLA fluency studies.</p> <p>The study reported here, examining longitudinal changes in L2 Mandarin fluency, thus aims to add to our understanding of fluency at the linguistic/temporal interface by reporting on data, gathered across four monologic and dialogic tasks, involving prepared and unprepared speech, and analysed using both CLAN and PRAAT. Participants are ten adult L1 English learners of Mandarin, assessed before and after a year's Study Abroad. We found that across tasks, oral measures generally showed clear improvement: in particular total mean output, speech rate, phonological accuracy increased significantly (p <.01). However, other measures such as accuracy and lexical diversity, hesitation and mean length of run differed between task, and were very variable across the group, highlighting individual differences particularly in processing prepared vs. unprepared speech demands. Even within the same task expected correlations between CLAN-based and PRAAT measures were not consistently found.</p> <p> </p> <p>This study highlights the value of collecting detailed longitudinal SLA-motivated datasets of language learners moving between instructed and immersed contexts (Du 2013), and using theoretically-grounded comparisons of linguistic and temporal fluency. However, there remain clear challenges for researching L2 fluency, especially comparing monologic vs dialogic tasks and prepared vs. unprepared speech (Pallotti 2009). We discuss theoretical, methodological and pedagogical implications of our data for systematic analysis of L2 oral development, particularly in L2 Mandarin.</p> <p> </p> <p>References:</p> <p>Du, H.

<p>Adults differ substantially in the success with which they learn a new language (L2). While some appear to learn the L2 effortlessly, others spend years trying without much success. L2 learning contexts are largely responsible for such differences (Hyltenstam & Abrahamsson, 2003), but in the past decades, second language acquisition (SLA) researchers showed an increasing interest in the role of learners' aptitude.</p> <p>Previous research on individual differences has mostly focused on investigating explicit, language-related aptitudes, e.g. grammar-learning ability, while largely ignoring potential domain-general aptitudes, e.g. statistical learning ability, which can provide more insight into cognitive mechanisms underlying adult SLA (DeKeyser, 2012; Granena, 2013). Also, most studies looked at individual differences of learners in naturalistic settings, where it is impossible to control for the amount and kind of language input learners received in their L2, which are likely the major sources of individual differences. Finally, few studies on individual differences measured learners' L2 knowledge by means of online/implicit processing tasks in addition to explicit knowledge tests.</p> <p>This study investigates to what extent and how adult language learners differ in learning a new language and a specific grammatical structure within that language when the amount and kind of input are identical for all learners. It also aims to explain individual differences by relating L2 learning success – measured by online and offline tests – to both language-specific and domain-general aptitudes.</p> <p>Fifty native speakers of Dutch (18 – 35 years old) received brief, auditory exposure to a new language based on Fijian, which included a determiner-noun agreement structure. During the instruction, learners looked at images and listened to sentences describing the images. They were encouraged to learn the language as well as they could but were not told what to focus on. After the instruction, participants' knowledge of the target structure was measured by a test of online processing (visual world eye-tracking) and two acceptability judgment tasks – one with new and one with familiar nouns. The learners also did an intelligence task and three aptitude tests: a visual statistical learning ability task, a grammatical inference task, and a sound recognition task.</p> <p>Results showed large individual differences in acquisition of the determiner-noun agreement structure. Several learning patterns were observed: 1) some learners were aware of the target structure during the instruction, which led to ceiling performance, 2) some learners were unaware of the structure during the instruction but were able to extract the rule based on their implicit knowledge during acceptability tasks, which led to good performance, 3) some learners were unaware of the target structure, and they relied on guessing or intuition during acceptability tasks, which led to above-chance performance when implicit knowledge was acquired, or chance performance when there was no learning. These results show that even when adult learners receive identical exposure to an L2, and when their intelligence is controlled for, their learning patterns and outcomes still differ considerably. In this presentation, we will explain the observed individual differences and present how they correlate with the different aptitudes measured.</p>

<p>Generative SLA (GenSLA) findings have always had the potential to translate into pedagogical implications, but this potential has been earnestly explored only recently (e.g. Whong, Gil, & Marsden, 2013). Following Widdowson (2000), we maintain that GenSLA researchers should act as mediators between linguists and teachers,<strong> </strong>translating insights from linguistic theory to instruction. As an example, we offer<strong> a syntax-discourse construction in Spanish: Clitic Left Dislocation (CLLD)</strong>. Although most instructional L2 Spanish-language textbooks devote sections to properties of accusative clitics, most notably placement and interpretation (Bruhn de Garavito, 2013), virtually none present examples or explanations of CLLD. CLLD, exemplified in (1), is a frequent and salient construction in which a left-dislocated (Topic) object is resumed by an agreeing clitic later in the sentence.</p> <p>(1) CONTEXT: Are you not going to the party with Elena? (Elena= topic)</p> <p>[A Elena]i sí *(lai) invitaron, pero a mí no.</p> <p>to Elena (fem.sg) yes cl.ACC.3f.sg invited.PAST.3rd.PL but to me NEG</p> <p>“Well, Elena was indeed invited, but I wasn't.”</p> <p>In Spanish, CLLD must be distinguished from Fronted Focus (FF), a similar construction that involves a dislocated phrase that is not clitic-doubled. FF has different interpretative properties, given that the dislocated element is Focus. Thus, successful comprehension and production of CLLD depends not only on knowledge of clitic placement but also on discourse-felicitousness considerations.</p> <p>In a recent study (Authors, 2014), we use a self-paced reading task to investigate whether L2 Spanish learners (English NSs; n=120) could successfully predict the upcoming appearance of a clitic based on a previously-appearing cue: a left-dislocated topic. Although English also uses fronted objects, albeit less frequently, for topicalization, topics cannot be resumed because English lacks clitics. Results demonstrated that learners were indeed able to predict the agreeing clitic, as shown by an emergent sensitivity to the expectation violations set up by the syntactic and discourse context. Not surprisingly, L2 proficiency (intermediate vs. advanced) was a strong predictor of native-like processing. Most relevantly, however, native-like processing of CLLD was strongly correlated with study abroad but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> length of study. This result underscores the fact that the quality of linguistic experience influences the ability to acquire such sensitivity.</p> <p>Following the insights of Slabakova (2008), we argue that L2 learners would benefit from instruction on CLLD that highlights the syntax-semantics-discourse mismatches between Spanish and English and is developmentally appropriate (i.e. only advanced learners would benefit from instruction). We suggest three areas of improvement: a) <strong>Professional development</strong>: L2 Spanish instructors should be aware not only of the syntactic properties of CLLD (e.g. case, agreement, placement) but also of the discourse-felicitousness conditions of CLLD (e.g. the dislocated element should be a topic) and how these differ from other, similar, constructions; b) <strong>Authentic input</strong>: learners should be exposed to contextually-rich authentic materials in which CLLD is used, such as movies and TV shows; and c) <strong>Communication-based practice</strong>: learners should be encouraged to use this property through communication-oriented activities which are strongly based in real-life discourse. We conclude by offering examples of such instructional materials. </p>

<p>Introduction. This paper focuses on the developmental relationship between receptive and productive second language (L2) grammar processing skills – an aspect of L2 acquisition which, although a crucial component of any model of L2 acquisition (Ellis 2008), is still open to many questions. More specifically, the project reported in this paper investigated whether the acquisition of receptive and of productive L2 grammar processing skills are driven by the same cognitive mechanisms, resulting in similar acquisition orders for certain morphosyntactic structures.</p> <p>Theoretical Framework. The theoretical framework is Processability Theory (PT) (Pienemann 1998). PT claims that L2 learners' development of productive grammar processing skills is governed by their acquisition of a set of universal, implicationally ordered “processing procedures” which allow them to exchange information within increasingly larger sentences constituents (e.g. phrase, clause). Originally intended as a theory of language production, there is a recent but growing interest in the applicability of PT to receptive grammar acquisition (e.g. Spinner 2013). The question asked, then, is whether the processing procedures hypothesized by PT also operate in receptive grammar acquisition, leading to the same developmental patterns.</p> <p>Design and Methodology. The study looked at learners' developing ability to process L2 English morphology. Participants were eighty-one adult learners with different proficiency levels and different L1 backgrounds (the latter to allow us to test PT's claim that the processing procedures are universal). Online processing skills (Ellis 2009; Roberts 2012) were measured by means of a self-paced reading (SPR) task and a timed grammaticality judgment task (GJT). Productive processing was measured by means of a movie-retelling task. The SPR task and GJT both test learners' ability to process six morphological phenomena hypothesized by PT to become processable at different stages of acquisition: genitive –‘s and past tense –ed (Stage 2), plural –s (Stage 3), be + -ing-form and have + past participle (Stage 4), and 3SG –s (Stage 5). In the SPR task, participants read grammatically correct and incorrect sentences on a computer, word-by-word and at their own pace, pressing the space bar after every word. For every morphological phenomenon, the reaction time (i.e. time passed between every space bar press) on critical words in grammatical sentences was compared to the reaction time in ungrammatical sentences. A significantly delayed reaction time in ungrammatical sentences is interpreted as evidence that learners can process the morpheme. In the timed GJT, participants read the same set of sentences, replying with ‘grammatically correct' or ‘incorrect'. In the production task, participants described what happened in a fragment of Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times. To determine whether the receptive grammar data confirmed PT, the data were analysed using implicational scaling – the commonly used method in PT-oriented research.</p> <p>Results. Results from the movie-retelling task confirm PT's predictions about mechanisms and stages in productive L2 grammar development. In contrast, results from the SPR task and GJT yield no evidence for the operation of the processing procedures posited by PT. Implications for the status of PT and for research on L2 development in general will be discussed.</p> <p> </p>

<p>Second language (L2) research investigating native and non-native differences has recently set out to identify processing procedures in these groups. Within this line of research, the mental representation/processing of inflected words in the L2 has received particular attention. It has been suggested that the two principal routes to processing of morphologically complex words (i.e., full-listing and decomposition) are available to native speakers but not to adult L2 learners (Clahsen & Felser, 2006; Clahsen et al., 2010). For example, while in the L1 English lexicon, irregular verbs (e.g., flew), are stored as a whole, regular verbs are decomposed into the root and suffix (e.g., walk – ed) (Pinker, 1999). In the L2 lexicon, however, regularly inflected words, like irregular words, are assumed to be stored as chunks due to L2 learners' problems with implicit linguistic computations (Ullman, 2004).</p> <p>The present study tested this hypothesis via a masked priming experiment measuring recognition/response time (RT) for regular and irregular verbs in L2 English. The prime-target pairs were presented in three prime conditions: i) Identity (save-SAVE; build-BUILD), (ii) Test (saved-SAVE; built-BUILD), and (iii) Unrelated (carry-SAVE; share-BUILD). Preliminary data from L1-Turkish-L2 English learners (n=45 advanced; n=45 upper-intermediate) and native English speakers (n=24) revealed significantly faster RTs for irregular verbs [F(1,111)=23.119, p=0.00] and a main effect of condition [F(2,222)=64.752, p=0.00] across all groups. Further paired-samples t-tests revealed priming effects only for regulars in all groups, suggesting decomposition. As for the irregular verbs, no priming effects were observed, possibly due to storage effects. These results lend support for the dual-mechanism view in morphological processing of past tense inflection in English. It seems that mid-to-high proficiency L2 speakers of English can employ the decomposition route in accessing inflected forms in the L2 similar to native speakers, as suggested by some of the earlier studies (e.g., Feldman et al., 2010; Gor & Jackson, 2013). Thus, comparable processing patterns in native and nonnative groups obtained in the present study oppose to earlier views that L2 learners are less sensitive to the morphological structure of the target language compared to native speakers (e.g., Clahsen et al. 2010).</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>REFERENCES</strong></p> <p>Clahsen, H., & Felser, C.

<p>This paper is about the design, development, implementation, deployment and evaluation of a semi-automated individual feedback generation system which aim is to foster writing proficiency development in English for specific purposes (ESP) amongst French threshold learners (equivalent to level B1 on the CEFR scales).</p> <p>In the approach which was taken, designing this tutoring tool first required to carry out an applied linguistics-centered research endeavor (between 2008 and 2010) to collect, analyze and quantify those learners' ESP needs when performing distance written tasks. This experiment showed that the problems encountered were always the same – thus outlining a typology – and that most obstacles derived from A2/B1 elements (CEFR, 2001) those learners had already been through during their secondary education. To circumvent this difficulty, those results led to hypothesize that an online tutoring system exposing learners to asynchronous focused recasts would be a relevant approach to follow, in so far as recasts would be an efficient means to (i) have learners notice (Rutherford, 1987), (ii) encourage various cognitive and meta-reflexive operations (e.g. attention to forms, form-focus instruction, etc.), (iii) trigger off potential learning sequences (De Pietro, Matthey & Py, 1989) and, by cascading effect, (iv) gain proficiency in their written production tasks.</p> <p>Following the conclusions of this research, a master file containing ready-made recasts – containing online references to relevant online help and exercises in line with the highlighted L2 obstacles – was made up, thus allowing to implement a system of semi-automated revision.</p> <p>Between the academic years 2011-2012 and 2012-2013, this semi-automatic online tutoring system enabling to generate individual recasts was incorporated in an experimental guided autonomy course in which 250 learners were enrolled each year. This study allowed to collect and analyze various sets of data (students' attendance, satisfaction and performance at the final exam) which results appeared to be encouraging. However, the tutoring system implied time-consuming practices for the tutor and the<strong> </strong>potential of the feedback system to<strong> </strong>foster L2 writing proficiency development could not be assessed at the time.</p> <p>To explore those questions, a web application enabling both to automate the master file and to monitor the informants' L2 progress (using a tracking device) was implemented<strong> </strong>in September 2013. Thanks to the database of the computer program, the highlighted problems could be monitored, quantified and followed up, thus allowing to identify potential L2 recurring mistakes and to assess the students' L2 writing proficiency. This tool was put to the test during the 2013-2014 academic year amongst 250 learners. </p> <p>In this paper, after presenting the theoretical framework of the study, the semi-automatic online tutoring system devised to foster (as much as possible) writing proficiency development in ESP will be described. Results concerning the impact of those tailor-made foreign language teaching and learning practices on the learners' L2 writing proficiency development in ESP will eventually be provided, thus contributing to a discussion on large-scale deployment of distance education solutions to address current issues related to individualized instruction and the expansion of educational opportunities in ESP at university level.<strong></strong></p> <p> </p>

<p>When speaking, there are a number of speech production processes that need to run smoothly in order for speakers to be fluent. First, when planning what to say (conceptualization), some plans may be more difficult than others, resulting in differences in utterance fluency. This holds for both speaking in the L1 and in the L2. However, the next step in speaking – constructing the utterances to be produced (formulation) – is usually more challenging and less automatized in the L2 than in the L1 because speakers have more linguistic knowledge and skills in their L1 compared to their L2. The last step in speaking involves articulating the formulated speech plan.</p> <p>We hypothesize that articulatory skills depend in part on individual differences, irrespective of language, such as the speed with which an individual can accomplish the articulatory targets in the production of sound sequences. Moreover, articulatory skills in a second language would be dependent on the individual levels of automatization of the articulatory gestures in the L2, such that more proficient L2 speakers would be more efficient in producing L2 sounds.</p> <p>This study investigates to what extent fluency in spontaneous speech can be explained by individual differences in L1 and L2 articulatory skills. In terms of Segalowitz's (2010) model of the L2 speaker, we investigate articulation, the last step in producing L2 speech at which dysfluencies might occur.</p> <p>A group of EFL learners (n=51) performed three semi-spontaneous speaking tasks in their L1, Spanish, and three similar speaking tasks in their L2, English. In addition, all participants performed two articulatory fluency tasks. The first of these tasks, the diadochokinetic (DDK)-task, measured participants' speed at moving their articulators. The second task, a delayed picture naming task, carried out in both the L1 and the L2, measured the speed at which participants could articulate their speech plans.</p> <p>The results show that, replicating earlier studies (De Jong et al., 2015), utterance fluency in the L2 can largely be predicted by the same fluency measures in the L1. This finding confirms the hypothesis that measures of L2 fluency are, for a substantial part, measures of personal speaking style, rather than of L2 proficiency. Initial analyses also suggest that speakers' faster movements of their articulators (as indicated by the DDK-task score) might be related to fewer pauses in L1 spontaneous speech, but not in L2 speech. We discuss the implications of these findings for Segalowitz's (2010) model of the L2 speaker and for the language testing practice.</p> <p> </p> <p>References:</p> <p>De Jong, N.H., Groenhout, R., Schoonen, R. & Hulstijn, J.H.

<p>Previously encountered auditory input is processed faster and more accurately than unheard input. This repetition effect occurs because the phonetic/phonological information in spoken input is encoded and stored in the listener's implicit memory, which facilitates subsequent speech processing (Church & Fisher, 1998).</p> <p>Our previous research has shown that L2 learners of English can benefit from one exposure to auditory words in terms of processing speed (Sugiura & Hori, 2012; Hori & Sugiura, 2014). With intensive repetition of auditory input, the repetition effect could contribute to the improvement of L2 pronunciation. Several studies highlighted the effect of repetition (e.g., oral repetition, shadowing) in improving L2 pronunciation in a classroom setting (e.g., Mori, 2011; Ofuka & Gilbert, 2013). However, it is still uncertain how many times L2 learners need to repeat the auditory input and what specific linguistic features in the presented auditory input they can attend to and assimilate to improve their pronunciation.</p> <p>To address these problems, two input factors that facilitate L2 acquisition, the amount and the quality of input, must be controlled during the repetition. As one of a series of experiments (Sugiura, 2013, 2014), the present study aimed to investigate whether the amount of input (5 or 10 times repetition) and the quality of input (word familiarity: high vs. low; stress patterns of a word: initial vs. final schwa) influence the improvement of the pronunciation of English schwa by Japanese speakers. The persistence of the effect (10min. vs. 1 week) was also examined.</p> <p>Twelve Japanese university students at the CEFR A2 English level participated in the present study. In the study phase, the participants were asked to repeat 22 English auditory words immediately after the presentation and to engage in a simple 10-minute distracter task to clear their short-term memory. In the test phase, they repeated 33 words, including words both heard and unheard in the study phase, and their productions were recorded. They took the same test 1 week later as well. For the analysis, the duration ratio of schwa to a stressed vowel in a word (duration ratio) and the quality (the first and second formant frequencies: F1 and F2) were acoustically analyzed.</p> <p>The statistical analyses showed no difference in the repetitive effect between the 5- and 10-time repetition and low and high familiarity word conditions for pronunciation improvement. Word stress patterns appeared to be related to the persistence of the repetition effect. For the duration ratio, the effect was obtained in both initial and final schwas in the 10-min. conditions, but the effect lasted 1 week for the words with initial schwa, which is a less common stress pattern for Japanese speakers. By contrast, regarding the quality, only in the F2 value of the final schwa, which is a more common stress pattern for Japanese speakers, did the repetitive effect lasted 1 week. We discuss the reasons for the greater repetition effect on weakly-represented structures and on the duration ratio than the quality from the perspective of L2 phonological processing and acquisition.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p>

<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;">This study investigates the effects of Age of Onset of Acquisition (AOA) and the quality and quantity of input on the longitudinal development of gender in the acquisition of French by simultaneous (2L1) and successive bilingual children (cL2). </span><span style="font-size: medium;">There's an on-going debate regarding the main factors underlying linguistic development in bilingual children. Two independent variables, </span><span style="font-size: medium;">AOA</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> and </span><span style="font-size: medium;">input</span><span style="font-size: medium;">, have been particularly emphasized and sometimes contrasted (Unsworth, 2013). Proponents of maturational accounts (e.g. Meisel, 2009) have argued that AOA is the main factor underlying language acquisition, but more recent research suggest that different aspects of language are more or less influenced by AOA and input respectively. Whereas lexical development seem to be particularly influenced by input properties (Thordardottir, 2011), the question is more open with respect to different grammatical features. One view is</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> that quantity and quality of input is particularly important in the acquisition of “late”, “harder” or “more opaque” grammatical structures (Gathercole, 2007; Unsworth, 2014), structures typically involving interface relationships of some kind (Sorace, 2005, Tsimpli, 2014). However, previous research has typically drawn on comparisons of different grammatical features in different languages which make controlled comparisons difficult.</span></span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Our contribution to the debate lies in the combined analysis of three different exponents of a single underlying linguistic construct in a single langue, namely French gender, an opaque feature according to Corbett (1991).

Recordings containing a variety of tasks took place in the age span 3;5 to 10 years, but no child was followed for more than three years. Two of the L2 children have an AOA below 4 years and two of them have an AOA above 4 years (cf. Meisel, 2009).

However, the discovery of the abstract GENDER features does not seem to be influenced by external input conditions. Group-level analyses of gender concord suggest that input is less important than AOA. In fact, only the cL2 group performed worst on concord than on attribution.

<p>Over the years, cross-linguistic influence (CLI) has repeatedly been shown to play an important role in L2 acquisition (Odlin 1989; Ringbom 2007). Recent research into the role of additional background languages in L3 acquisition also reveals strong CLI effects (Cenoz, Hufeisen & Jessner 2001). The relative importance of the L1 versus the L2 in CLI is not yet decisive, however, especially with respect to the early stages, which are believed to be particularly susceptible to CLI (De Angelis 2007). An additional factor that has received little attention is the effect of the target language (TL) input on the relative importance of background languages in the acquisition of a new language.</p> <p>The present study investigates the influence of background languages and linguistic input on learners' productions during a route direction task following intensive instructional input. The data for the study were collected during a language course for absolute beginners. Native speakers of French (n=17) and German (n=20), with English as an L2, studied Polish for two weeks (14 hours total). As of the third lesson, the teacher began to use constructions of static space (e.g. Sabina mieszka w Londynie “Sabina lives in London”). During the fourth and fifth lessons, the teacher introduced several verbs of motion (e.g. iść “to go”, skręcać “to turn”), other expressions of static space (e.g. Gdzie znajduje się? “Where is [it] located?”, and basic spatial expressions with prepositions (e.g. na “on”, na prawo “on the right”, na lewo “on the left”). On the sixth day (after approximately 7.5 hours of instruction), the instructor introduced new constructions to talk about dynamic space (e.g. iść prosto “Go straight”). These verb-preposition and verb-adverb structures were regularly reviewed and practiced in subsequent lessons in preparation for a production task in which participants were asked to give directions to a naïve interviewer.</p> <p>Giving directions in Polish requires the use of inflectional morphology. In the input, nouns following spatial prepositions mark one of two cases, accusative or genitive, and nouns following verbs of motion show instrumental case. Three cases are therefore mobilized by this task.</p> <p>Given that German attests more inflectional morphology than French or English, one hypothesis is that the learners with German L1 will produce more variable inflections on their nouns and verbs. However, given the consistent nature of the input, a second hypothesis is that the input will override potential L1 and L2 effects.</p> <p>In order to identify what aspects of the learner productions revealed L1, L2 and/or input effects, learners' productions on the route direction task were compared to the Polish input, as well as to productions of control group participants comprising native speakers of French, German and English. Preliminary results show a robust effect of the input with some traces of L1 and L2 influence on Polish L3. Discussion will include a qualitative analysis for investigating learners' productions at the initial stages relative to the input received.</p> <p> </p>

However, very few studies have closely examined the ultimate grammars of child L2 starters to ascertain their target-like convergence (e.g., <a href="#_ENREF_1" target="_blank" title="Hyltenstam, 2000 #575">Hyltenstam & Abrahamsson, 2000</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_2" target="_blank" title="Hyltenstam, 2003 #577">2003</a>; <a href="#_ENREF_4" target="_blank" title="Nishikawa, 2014 #569">Nishikawa, 2014</a>). These studies have found that not all child L2 starters can be target-like in the domains of lexical-grammar or morpho-syntax even after many years of sustained exposure to the target language.</p> <p>This study aims to go some way towards filling the empirical gap by testing whether highly proficient child L2 starters when scrutinised on subtle linguistic detail would ultimately pass as target-like. Adopting a generative approach, the study attempts a detailed analysis of L2 performance on a cluster of morphosyntactic properties that differ in feature interpretability between L1 Arabic and L2 English. In a maturational-based account, properties associated with uninterpretable features (but not interpretable) are assumed to be vulnerable in post-puberty L2 acquisition (<a href="#_ENREF_6" target="_blank" title="Tsimpli, 2007 #403">Tsimpli & Dimitrakopoulou, 2007</a>).</p> <p>The tested properties include the impermissibility of resumptive pronouns in English complex wh-interrogatives (e.g., Who do you think Mary met (*him)?) and null-operator constructions (e.g., The paint on the shirt is hard to remove (*it)), verb phrase ellipsis in strict and partial morphological identity conditions (e.g., John will be here, and Mary will too vs. *John is happy, and Mary will soon), and adverb placement (e.g., Mary quickly revised the lesson vs. *Mary revised quickly the lesson).</p> <p>A bimodal timed acceptability judgment task was designed to collect intuitive L2 data. It had 164 items with 48 testing resumptive pronouns, 40 verb phrase ellipsis, and 48 adverb placement. To obtain overall balance in (un)-grammatical conditions, 28 ungrammatical distracters were included.</p> <p>The study sample consisted of 34 highly proficient Arabic L2 speakers of English and 15 English controls. Their average age at testing was 27.18 years. By age of onset, two groups were defined: 1-6 years (n=19) and 7-13 years (n=15). Their length of exposure to English in an English-speaking country varies from short to long extended study abroad experience (2-13 years). The L2 speakers were highly educated and active bilinguals in both languages. From a population of university instructors and graduate students, they were objectively screened using the oxford placement test, vocabulary levels test (<a href="#_ENREF_3" target="_blank" title="Nation, 2002 #578">Nation, 2002</a>), and background questionnaire.</p> <p>Results provide further evidence that divergence from target-like grammars is inevitable even among child L2 starters regardless of their apparent high proficiency level. Results from error rates produced on ungrammatical conditions show that resumptive pronouns are the most problematic, whereas conditions on adverb placement and verb phrase ellipsis are the least problematic, respectively. Of all properties, the error rates on resumptive pronouns were significantly higher than that of the native speakers'. Individual results show inter-speaker divergence across age of onset. The study concludes age of onset is not sufficient to account for divergence. The implications of these results for accounts that claim that L2 acquisition is maturationally constrained are discussed. </p>

<p>The role of incidental focus on form (FonF) has recently received considerable attention in the field of second language acquisition (SLA). Incidental FonF refers to attention to form that arises naturally and spontaneously “in lessons whose overriding focus is on meaning or communication'' (Long, 1991, pp. 45-46). In recent years, a number of studies have investigated the role of such FonF in L2 classrooms (e.g., Ellis et al., 2001a, 2001b; Ellis, Basturkmen, & Loewen, 2002; Loewen, 2005; Loewen & Philp, 2006; Lyster & Ranta, 1997; Nassaji, 2010, 2013; Panova & Lyster, 2002; Sheen, 2004, 2008; Williams, 2001; Zhao & Bitchener, 2007). These studies have provided important insights into the use and effectiveness of incidental FonF. However, important variations have also been noted in the results of these studies. These differences have often been explained in terms of cognitive/linguistic factors or characteristics of FonF. However, factors such as those related to the nature and organization of classroom discourse have not been examined. The present study investigated the role of two aspects of classroom discourse, episode activity orientation and episode exchange type, and their relationship with the use and effectiveness of FonF. The study involved an extensive database of classroom interaction collected from 7 adult communicatively-oriented ESL classrooms. The classes were video- and audio-recorded using a digital recorder with a wireless clip-on microphone attached to the teacher. The interaction data were transcribed and examined for the different types of episode activity orientations and different types of FonF. Following Ellis et al (2001), three types of FonF were identified: reactive, student-initiated preemptive, and teacher-initiated preemptive FonF. Reactive FonF was FonF that took place in response to an actual error or a linguistic problem. Preemptive FonF took place irrespective of an error and was initiated either by the teacher or by the student. Based on the type and nature of the talk in which the learners and the teacher participated (Nassaji and Wells 2000), each FonF exchange was further coded in terms of their higher-order discourse activity goals and episode exchange relations. Four types of discourse activity orientations (instruct, explore, plan, and report) and two types of episode exchange relations (nuclear and bound) were identified and coded. Learners' immediate uptake and repair in response to FonF were used to measure the effectiveness of FonF during interaction. The results showed a significant relationship between episode activity orientation and type of FonF, with the largest proportion of both preemptive and reactive FonF occurring in episodes with ‘instruct' as their episode activity orientation. Significant relationships were also found between the amount and type of FonF and the episode exchange type, with preemptive FonF occurring in more bound and nuclear exchanges than reactive FonF. Learner uptake and repair tended to occur more frequently in bound exchanges than in nuclear exchanges. These findings provide evidence for the important role that classroom discourse may play in the occurrence and usefulness of classroom FonF. </p>

<p>This paper explores effects of surface similarity between L1 and L2 structures on potential syntactic transfer in L2 comprehension. A picture-choice task tests for effects of particle placement on the comprehension of wh-questions in L1 German-L2 English. </p> <p>There is partial overlap between constituent orders in English and German simple tense wh-questions with particle verbs. In English subject questions, the particle may appear adjacent to the verb (continuous order), or after the object NP (discontinuous order) with no effect on thematic interpretation, as in (1). The verb second and verb-final properties of German mean that separable prefixes must appear clause-finally, see (2).</p> <p>(1) Who picks (up) John (up)?</p> <p>(2) Wer holt (*ab) Hans (ab)?</p> <p>The discontinuous order in English is linearly identical to constituent order in German main clause wh-questions with prefix verbs. However, because interpretation in German is conditioned by case and agreement morphology, this order may be either a subject question or an object question (3 and 4).</p> <p>(3) Wer holt Hans ab?</p> <p>who-nom pick-3ps Hans prt</p> <p>‘Who picks Hans up?'</p> <p>(4) Wen holt Hans ab?</p> <p>Who-acc pick-3ps Hans prt</p> <p>‘Who(m) does Hans pick up?'</p> <p>If German-speaking learners of English apply an L1 parse to L2 input, they can accommodate subject questions in the discontinuous order, but they may misinterpret these as object questions. By contrast, subject questions in the continuous order and object questions with do-support are not amendable to a German parse and thus should not show effects of cross-linguistic influence.</p> <p>These predictions were tested on the basis of a picture-choice task administered to 17 upper-intermediate L1 German learners of L2 English, and 10 native English-speaking controls. Participants were presented with questions in the context of two pictures. A target picture depicted a subject interpretation of a subject question or an object interpretation of an object question; distractor pictures depicted an object interpretation of a subject question, and vice-versa. Participants provided responses to a total of 32 questions, 16 with particle verbs and 16 fillers. Of the 16 particle-verb questions, 8 were object questions and 8 were subject. Half of the subject questions were in the continuous order and half in the discontinuous order.</p> <p>The results showed no significant difference in target response rates between learners and natives for object questions (95.5% vs. 99%). By contrast, learners provided fewer target responses to subject questions overall (learners 91% vs. natives 99%). Critically, however, this difference in target response rates was conditioned by particle placement in subject questions. Learners provided significantly lower rates of target responses to subject questions in the discontinuous order vs. the continuous order (86.7 vs. 95.6%).</p> <p>These results suggest that learners at higher proficiency may still be influenced by properties of the L1 during L2 comprehension. Where English clauses are linearly compatible with a German parse, learners are more likely to provide non-target interpretations in line with those permitted in German. Similar effects are not identifiable for clauses which do not share a surface word order pattern with German.</p>

<p>In recent studies into motivation to learn a second language (L2 motivation), it is proved that intercultural contact with different cultures play critical roles as the factors of L2 motivation. For example, Dörnyei and Csizér (2005) explained intercultural contact as both a means and an end in L2 studies. A longitudinal study in Hungary by Dörnyei et al. (2006) examined the relationships between L2 motivation and intercultural contact with English and other regionally important languages. The comparative study, which targeted those learning English and German as foreign languages in Hungary, observed that the differences in the motivation of the language learners was caused by their levels of intercultural contact and emphasized the importance of such contact (Csizér & Kormos, 2008). This study focuses on how intercultural contact affects learners' L2 selves, since the L2 Motivational Self System including Ideal and Ought-to L2 Self (Dörnyei, 2005, 2009a) accounts for the cultural identity in the socio-dynamic perspective of L2 motivation (Dörnyei & Ushioda, 2009; Ryan, 2006). As of research sites, Finland is one of the countries that have two official languages as a result of the control under Sweden. Therefore, Swedish continues to be one of the official languages of Finland. However, in the age of globalisation in Europe, the global language, English gained power in Finland and most of the population learn English in compulsory education. Therefore, the main research questions of this study are 1) to investigate the differences of the relationships between L2 selves and intercultural contact depending on target language; and 2) to explore the factors promoting attitudes toward English and Swedish language learning in Finland. This study analyses the result of a questionnaire survey concerning L2 selves, attitudes toward learning English and Swedish, as well as the frequency of having intercultural contacts related to those target languages. Items concerning the frequency of the intercultural contact are based on the result of a preliminary qualitative sampling. In the preliminary sampling, 13 Finnish university students were asked to write about their experiences on intercultural contacts in daily life. Keywords were picked up from the collected written data, and items were then finalised into a form of questionnaire sheet and distributed to 32 Finnish university students in the form of an online survey. Responses to the questionnaire were analysed quantitatively with correlation technique, multiple comparison, and multi-regression analysis. As a result of analyses, the scores of motivational scales and intercultural contact scales, as well as the relationships among those variables differ between English and Swedish with statistical significance and moderate to large effect size. Also, regression analysis showed two different models predicting attitudes toward learning English and Swedish.</p> <p>Csizér, K., & Kormos, J. (2008).

<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Empirical research in L1 acquisition has successfully documented the prominent role of formulaic language in the development of child grammars (e.g., Bannard & Lieven, 2012). In L2 acquisition, empirical studies on formulaic language have pursued two main research directions: (1) investigating the formulaic status of the target structures and their various operationalizations (Conklin & Schmitt, 2008; Durrant & Doherty, 2010; Ellis, Simpson-Vlach, & Maynard, 2008; O'Donnell, Rӧmer, & Ellis, 2013) and (2) examining L2 learners' construction development along the predicted path from relying on formulaic patterns to gradually developing more abstract exemplars (Bardovi-Harlig, 2002; Hall, 2010; Eskildsen, 2008; 2011; 2012; Eskildsen & Cadierno, 2007; Li, Eskildsen, & Cadierno, 2014; Myles, Hooper, & Mitchell, 1998). Since the two questions (i.e., processing and use of formulaic chunks) are typically explored separately in individual studies, frequency of occurrence has been the most widely used criterion of formulaicity employed in construction development research. Based on the frequency with which a chunk occurs in the data, inferences are made about how formulaic and/ or productive it is in L2 learners' repertoire. The present study examined both the processing and usage characteristics of formulaic patterns employed by L2 learners longitudinally. </span></span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;"> </span></p> <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The purpose of this exploratory study was to evaluate the status of frequent L2 question patterns which occurred in L2 learners' (N=41) production data collected over a period of 32 weeks. To identify target question sequences, a corpus of transcribed oral interactions between the researcher and each participant (all L1 Russian speakers at two different levels of language proficiency) involved in the study was analyzed. Nineteen of the most frequently used question patterns were selected, including both grammatical and ungrammatical sequences. Next, the processing characteristics of these sequences were examined in an on-line grammaticality judgment task (using DMDX software). In order to provide baseline data for comparison, the processing task was administered to 25 additional participants who were native speakers of American English from a similar age group and a comparable academic background (i.e., non-language/ linguistics majors). Participants' reaction times for the frequent patterns and corresponding non-formulaic stretches were recorded and then compared. The results indicated that the majority of frequent question patterns were processed faster than their non-formulaic counterparts by both L1 and L2 participants. Frequent ungrammatical patterns, however, were processed more slowly by both participant groups. Furthermore, the most frequently occurring grammatical patterns which L2 participants employed in a variety of contexts in the production data (e.g., do you have..., where do you..., what is your...) showed greater processing advantage compared to more entrenched but less productive chunks (e.g., How are you? How do you do?). This effect however, was not observed for native speaker participants. The implications of the study are discussed in terms of highlighting the characteristics of linguistic chunks which seem to have a greater potential for being recognized by L2 learners as relevant and useful exemplars to rely on in their interlanguage development. </span></span></p> <p><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;"> </span></strong></p> <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;"> </span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;"> </span></p>

<p>To date, the results of the phonological training studies aimed at improving lexical access in L2 have been mixed. Some have shown that it is, in fact, possible to develop sensitivity to a non-native contrast to aid word recognition (e.g., Perfors & Dunbar, 2010), while others have failed to demonstrate this result (e.g., Dufour, Nguyen, & Frauenfelder, 2010).</p> <p>One potential explanation for the lack of success is the possibility that sensitivity to a phonological contrast could be a consequence of generalization based on the available lexical items that contain the contrast (top-down route) rather than a result of direct phonological influence on the minimal pair discrimination (bottom-up route), which is in line with child language acquisition theories (Charles-Luce & Luce, 1990; Walley, 1993).</p> <p>The current study aims at identifying which route (top-down or bottom-up) contributes most significantly to the development of adequate phonological representations in a second language (L2).</p> <p>Bottom-up processing relies on perceptual phonetic properties alone, while top-down processing relies on lexical properties, such as word onset probabilities in the encountered input.

<p>There is no agreement on how second language (L2) learners process morphologically complex words. The masked-priming data indicate that L2 learners do not decompose inflected words in lexical access (Clahsen et al., 2010, 2013), which is in conformity with observed L2 morphosyntactic deficits in sentence processing (Jiang, 2007; Coughlin & Tremblay, 2013). Conversely, an increasing body of research supports L2 decomposition of inflected words (Feldman et al., 2010; Gor & Cook, 2010; Gor & Jackson, 2013; Coughlin & Tremblay, 2014).</p> <p>This study explores the role of two factors in nonnative processing of inflection, as tested in two auditory lexical decision (LDT-1/2) and auditory-visual cross-modal priming (CMP-1/2) tasks. It evaluates the role of proficiency by comparing two groups of Russian learners at different proficiency levels, advanced and superior, and the role of early/late start by comparing early starters (heritage speakers) and late English-speaking L2 learners matched in Russian proficiency.</p> <p>LDTs used Latin-square design and compared the processing costs to overtly and zero-inflected nouns in the Nominative and Genitive cases (bumag-a paperNomFemSg—bumag-ø paperGenFemPl and zavod-ø factoryNomMascSg—zavod-a factoryGenMascSg). In LDT-1 with native (L1) and late L2 participants, both bumag-ø and zavod-a showed decomposition costs in L1 speakers. A different effect was observed in low-proficiency L2 speakers, who showed a false advantage in processing the zero-inflected Genitive plural bumag-ø as fast as the Nominative singular bumag-a, with no decomposition cost. Decomposition costs emerged in L2 high-proficiency participants. In LDT-2, early and late learners showed similar patterns of decomposition costs for oblique cases, but not for citation forms.</p> <p>In CMP-1 with ambiguous case-inflected adjective primes (nov-oj newGen/InstrFemSg) and noun targets (mashin-yGenFemSg or mashin-oj car InstrFemSg), L1 speakers responded faster to Genitive-inflected (a high type-frequency inflection) than Instrumental-inflected (a low type-frequency inflection) nouns, while this response bias emerged only in the high-proficiency L2 group. In CMP-2, late but not early learners showed sensitivity to oblique case probabilities. The findings support the special status of the Nominative case, as stated in the satellite-entries hypothesis (Lukatela et al., 1980), and further demonstrate how oblique case differences impact case predictability in adjective-noun case agreement.</p> <p>The study identifies two reasons why nonnative processing of inflected nouns may lead to morphosyntactic insensitivity. First, L2 speakers decompose inflected words to access the lexical entry via the stem, but they do not necessarily recompose and check it to process morphosyntactic information. And second, nonnative speakers are less efficient in their use of statistical probabilities related to the inflectional paradigm—in particular, case frequencies. Crucially, late L2 learners and early starters use similar mechanisms in decomposing inflected words. Affix stripping (as in zavod-a factoryGenMascSg) is a more basic processing strategy, and is applied by all groups of native and nonnative participants. However, two aspects of nominal inflection—the recomposition and checking stage of inflected word processing (as in bumag-ø paperGenFemPl), and sensitivity to case probabilities—gradually develop with increasing L2 proficiency. </p>

To repair these communication breakdowns, L2 learners must incidentally focus on linguistic form by noticing the gap between their own linguistic errors and targetlike production, as well as through modified output with a primary focus on meaning (i.e., negotiation for meaning). While much research attention has been given to examining how interaction promotes L2 acquisition processes, most existing studies have been exclusively concerned with the role of interaction in L2 morphosyntax development, and have only involved a brief amount of interaction treatment (1-2 hours).</span></span></p> <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> Using a pre- and post-test design, the current study aimed to re-examine whether and to what degree conversational interaction can be facilitative of the longitudinal development of global (comprehensibility) and linguistic (pronunciation, fluency, vocabulary, grammar) compositions of spontaneous L2 speech production. During the nine-week treatment over one academic semester, the students in the experimental group (n = 20) engaged in weekly, one-hour conversation exchanges with native speakers via Google Hangout. The native speaking interlocutors were encouraged to provide interactional feedback in the form of recasts whenever the non-native speakers' utterances hindered successful understanding. The students in the control group (n = 20) received regular foreign language instruction which mainly consisted of reading and listening exercises without any interaction with native speakers. The spontaneous production of the participating students was elicited via two speaking tasks—a timed picture description and IELTS long-turn interview—at the beginning and end of the project. These samples were first judged by 10 native speaking raters for overall comprehensibility (ease of understanding) and foreign accentedness (linguistic nativelikeness), and then submitted to pronunciation, fluency, vocabulary and grammar analyses. </span></span></p> <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> The results showed that: (a) the experimental group demonstrated significant improvement in terms of enhanced comprehensibility, but not reduced accentedness; (b) such comprehensibility development was particularly ascribed to the students' use of adequate and varied prosody, optimal speech rate, and proper lexicogrammar; and (c) the gains were unclear regarding how the students could further refine the sophisticated aspects of their language (i.e., segmentals, lexical richness, grammatical complexity) not directly linked with successful comprehensibility. The findings suggest that the effectiveness of interaction on L2 oral ability development is substantially related to learner goals (comprehensibility vs. accentedness) as well as language domain (pronunciation, fluency, vocabulary, grammar). While L2 interaction alone can impact the development of those linguistic features linked with comprehensibility, it may be necessary to intentionally draw learners' attention to those linguistic features which have less communicative value and are more associated with accentedness.</span></span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;"> </span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;">Long, M.

<p> </p> <p>This study investigates the role of the L1 in the acquisition of L2 Korean case particles by learners with English, Chinese and Japanese L1. Lardiere's (2009) proposal of feature (re)assembly argues that checking and realizing features requires a complex procedure involving not only uninterpretable grammatical features but also interpretable ones. She notes that L1s and L2s with similar features might cause success or failure in L2A, if similar L1 features require reassembly in L2. Sabourin et al. (2006) discuss two types of transfer, namely surface (similar overt morphology) and deep (same abstract features such as the structural case shared by these four languages). </p> <p>In L2 Korean, especially in terms of case particles, Japanese, English and Chinese have different degrees of transfer. All three languages are nominative/accusative case languages, but Japanese has similar morphological exponents (suffixes) to Korean. English overt case is only realized in pronoun NPs (not bound morphemes). Chinese is even more morphologically impoverished in terms of overt case. Hence a transfer from Japanese to Korean can be considered a surface transfer while a transfer from English or Chinese to Korean would be considered a deep transfer. Furthermore, Japanese and Korean have similar topic/nominative distinction while the distinctive notion of topic and nominative is new in English and Chinese.</p> <p>The current study investigated the role of L1 in acquisition of Korean case particles by administering oral and written tasks to intermediate learners of Korean: 21 Japanese, 27 English and 22 Chinese speakers, totalling 70 participants in all.<strong> </strong>Learners of all three L1s used case particles more correctly in the written data (Japanese 93.7%, English 87.8%, Chinese 86.5% respectively) than in the spoken data (84.2%, 76.2%, 62.1% respectively).</p> <p>Japanese speakers were more accurate in both the written and spoken tasks. Learners' oral production clearly indicates the discrepancies as based on their L1s. While English and Chinese learners performed well in the written task (English 87.85% and Chinese 86.5%), their oral data was significantly different (English 76.2% and Chinese 62.1%). This may be due to the fact that although English and Chinese do not have morphemes for case particles equivalent to Korean or Japanese, the distinct forms for the subject and object pronouns in English facilitate the outperformance of English learners. Both theoretical proposals—feature reassembly and transfer (deep and surface)—are supported by this data.</p> <p> </p> <p>References</p> <p>Lardiere, D. 2009.

<p>A well-documented curricular gap exists in second language (L2) pedagogy between the introductory courses, focusing mainly on language, and advanced courses, focusing mainly on content (Byrnes, Maxim & Norris, 2010). Advanced learners, despite their proficiency, generally have difficulty in bridging this curricular gap, as it requires a shift from decoding basic information in texts to interpreting and analyzing texts. In order to bridge or close the gap for L2 learners, this research aimed to promote the development of intermediate learners' L2 narrative literacy abilities while studying this development in the process of formation. A concept-based instructional (CBI) approach (Haenen, 1996), based on Sociocultural Theory (Vygotsky, 1978), was developed and then implemented during a twelve-week pedagogical intervention. This study investigated the extent to which a CBI approach promoted the development of learners' L2 narrative literacy abilities as well as their understanding and use of three concepts. These concepts included Foundation (see Cole, 1996), Organization (see Mandler, 1984), and Genre (see Byrnes, Maxim, & Norris, 2010; Halliday & Hasan, 1989).</p> <p>Two groups of four L2 learners of French (7 L1 English and 1 L1 Chinese) were provided with the three theoretical concepts, materializations of these concepts, and literacy activities. A division-of-labor pedagogy was created to complement the CBI approach, which entailed dividing each of the three concepts into four roles. At the beginning, learners had the opportunity to work on one role at a time for each concept during the literacy activities, before they took on more responsibility. With each learner providing their role work to the group, each member of the group was able to participate in the entire literacy activity while only bearing a portion of the responsibility. Mediation was provided as needed at both the individual and group level.</p> <p>The data includes audio/video recordings of the learners' performance during the twelve weeks of L2 literacy activities, written verbalization data, a written summary for each text, and survey data. In addition, independent raters were used to rank order the texts in terms of level of difficulty as well as to score the pre- and post-test text summaries. The summaries were scored using a rubric with the following five categories: main idea, supporting details, synthesis, generalizations, and accuracy. To trace the learners' development, the text summaries, verbalization data, and performance data were analyzed. Learners' scores on written summaries of both mid- and high-level texts improved significantly after instruction (t(7)=2.68, p<0.05, d=1.67; t(5)=4.62, p<0.05, d=2.71, power=0.95 respectively). The learners' understanding of the concepts developed along with the manner in which they used the concepts to guide their thinking/performance. They were able to take on more responsibility for roles in the division-of-labor pedagogy. Learners felt more confident in reading, interpreting, and analyzing texts and knew how to investigate textual elements. They understood that language involves making choices to create particular effects. These findings suggest that the learners were able to use these concepts as tools for thinking in literacy activities and therefore, the language-literature gap can be bridged or closed.</p>

<p>A number of studies have shown that the source language of transfer can be related to factors such as proficiency, L2 status, recency, and psychotypology. These factors have proven especially relevant for spoken data, as shown in an earlier, quantitative study (Neuser, 2015) on transfer in TLA. This study looked at lexical transfer into L4 English from Luxemburgish, German and French among 14-year-olds in Luxemburg. The suggested model correctly predicted over 10% fewer outcomes for the written data as compared to the spoken data. Proficiency and exposure in particular were better predictors in speaking than writing. Both these factors may lead to greater activation and thus accessibility, which is more relevant for spoken production than written due to its spontaneous nature, the need for faster processing and reduced monitoring. These results thus suggest that other factors may be at play during writing.</p> <p>Writing is a more controlled process, allowing time to think, to scan all available options and to make a careful decision in choosing the best possible lexical item. Kellerman (1978) describes the learner as an active decision-maker on what linguistic structures may be transferable, while Bouvy (2000) discusses the importance of item-specific markedness of a potentially transferable item. She found that her Dutch learners of English were more reluctant to transfer [Dutch] bezuinigen than [Dutch] sparen (both mean “to save money” in English). That is, she observed a preference for non-marked items that require fewer changes, i.e. less foreignising. During a picture naming task in a previous pilot study, also in Luxemburg, a similar pattern was identified. Learners had acquired three other languages prior to English and so had multiple sources to draw from. While no consistent pattern was found per student, i.e. a preference for a particular source language, some items elicited 80% transfer from one of the three available source languages from all students. While Bouvy's (2000) findings, were within-language only, the results from this picture naming task may indicate that this process is also at work across languages.</p> <p>One promising direction for future research could thus be the investigation of whether potential transfer items are scanned across languages and compared for their level of markedness as an integral part of transfer strategies. While Kellerman (1978) used acceptability judgments for the transfer of expressions and a lexical decision task on the acceptability of specific items has been piloted, other reliable means of testing and measuring transferability still need to be established. Focus groups, stimulated recalls, and think-aloud protocols may provide valuable insight into the selection process, while carefully selected stimuli seem essential in determining the degree of markedness governing a particular choice. Conducting the study in Luxembourg, where students have acquired three typologically related languages before learning English (Luxembourgish, German, and French), allows for a broad range of pairings of marked vs. unmarked items, thus producing more reliable results. Furthermore, using young informants aged 13-14, during their second year of English instruction, may solidify previous results of increased crosslinguistic awareness, apparent even in young multilingual learners.</p>

<p> Foreign and second language (L2) teachers differ in their individual understandings of the language concepts they teach. These differences inevitably shape pedagogical decisions, for example during explicit classroom instruction. Research has indicated that explicit instruction is useful, but only if the instructional content is good. However, identifying good metalinguistic descriptions is a challenge requiring complex understandings of myriad factors, such as language concepts, the students' level, and their learning trajectory. To understand teachers' in-the-moment instructional decisions, we must delve into understanding their Knowledge about Language (KAL), or metalinguistic knowledge. In working with teachers, researchers must avoid prescribing what teachers should know and testing for discrete knowledge points, actions which result in a deficit framing of teachers. The purpose of my research is to investigate teachers' knowledge construction in realistic settings and illuminate its complexity.</p> <p> In a small-scale study, I investigated the complexity of teachers' KAL using Andrea DiSessa's Pieces of Knowledge framework. This framework allows a more in-depth description of teacher KAL because it defines knowledge as being constructed at a specific point in time and as composed of a network of pieces as opposed to discrete whole concepts. In order to explore L2 teachers' KAL in a setting that approximates instructional contexts, I used Cognitive Clinical Interviews (CCIs), a task-based semi-structured interview method, to investigate how non-native speaker teachers of French as a foreign language understand the passé composé (composed past) and the imparfait (imperfect). Unlike previous research on teacher KAL, this study focused on providing a detailed description and analysis of the knowledge pieces that participants used to construct their understandings. The tasks, which included an oral description, a drawing, and correcting a sample student's work, were designed to elicit in-the-moment thinking that could realistically occur in a classroom setting.</p> <p> Unsurprisingly, the participants had complex understandings of the past tenses, ranging from morphology to discourse and context. However, their reliance on one-to-one relationships between form and function and simplified rules-of-thumb were sometimes in conflict with their accurate intuitions about language in use. Overall, the results suggest that 1) language teachers can have complex understandings of language features and that these understandings are composed of core and peripheral knowledge; 2) it is plausible that language users have different levels and means of reliance on intuition and KAL, particularly when the two conflict; and 3) the knowledge constructed involves both domain-specific and domain-general knowledge.</p> <p> This study has resulted in important theoretical and methodological advances for the study of teacher KAL. It serves as a first step in reframing teacher KAL and valuing teachers' multifaceted understandings. Additionally, the CCIs proved an innovative method for understanding teacher KAL in use. These advances can inform teacher education and methods of evaluating teacher KAL in professional and research settings.</p>

<p>It is well-established that formulaic language is an essential part of the English lexicon (Wray, 2002), and thus should be known by L2 speakers in order to produce fluent and authentic language. Phrasal verbs are one type of formulaic sequences that are very common in English. For example, based on a search of the British National Corpus (BNC), Gardner and Davies (2007) estimated that learners will encounter one phrasal verb in every 150 words of English on average. Phrasal verbs are therefore an important component of English vocabulary. Because they are widely used in spoken informal discourse, failure to use them in such situations is likely to make language sound unnatural and non-idiomatic. However, they are often considered as one of the most challenging features of the English language, and have been shown to be prone to avoidance by previous research. Contrary to other types of formulaic sequences such as idioms or collocations, very little research has been carried out on phrasal verb knowledge until now. In addition, vocabulary research has over the years pointed to some determining factors in predicting word acquisition, notably word frequency, semantic opacity, amount of L2 instruction, and degree of involvement/exposure with the language. But the effect of these factors on phrasal verb knowledge is unknown. Therefore, the aim of this presentation is to offer an insight into L2 knowledge of English phrasal verbs on one hand, and to assess its relationship with each of the afore-mentioned factors on the other hand. To this aim, 128 participants were recruited (all MA TEFL students from Chile) to take an off-line productive test in the form of a gap-fill task, assessing form recall knowledge of some of the most frequent phrasal verbs in English (N=100). This was followed by the completion of self-report questionnaires in which the participants provided information about their language learning background. The results show that participants knew less than half of the tested items on average (Mean: 40.5; Min: 4; Max: 93; SD: 18.5). Word frequency as extrapolated from the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) was found to have a moderate effect on knowledge, accounting for 16.5% of the variance in item scores. Semantic opacity and amount of L2 instruction had no effect on test scores. A significant positive relationship was found between participant scores and the amount of everyday engagement with the L2, and more specifically the number of hours spent reading and watching films or TV in English. The study has a number of teaching implications. First, it emphasizes the need for teaching phrasal verbs as they present difficulties for many learners of English, including presumably advanced ones. Second, it highlights the importance of maximizing learners' exposure to authentic language (for example, via reading books or watching films in English).</p> <p>References</p> <p>Gardner, D., & Davies, M.

<p>Recently, we have noticed an increasing interest in the incidental acquisition of vocabulary through multimodal input, i.e., video with second language (L2) subtitles. Yet, most gains in those studies were found at the level of form recognition while gains at the level of meaning-related aspects were low. This is not surprising since L2 subtitles do not provide access to meaning and successful word meaning inferences are challenging. Another important concern has been the sensitivity of the vocabulary tests used, with the majority of studies using explicit form and meaning tests. Yet, these tests are often unable to detect gains at the earliest stages of acquisition. Therefore, this study (1) investigates other types of subtitles, which vary in the presence of target and native language (L1) to stimulate vocabulary uptake from video and (2) uses a combination of explicit and more sensitive measures, which tap into tacit knowledge, that is, knowledge that learners cannot report or control, such as their reaction times on lexical decision tasks (Elgort & Warren, 2014).</p> <p>One hundred and sixty Dutch-speaking university students were semi-randomly assigned to one of the four conditions: (1) video only, (2) video with L2 subtitles, (3) video with L1 subtitles, (4) video with L2 subtitles and access to meaning (i.e., the L1 translation of >4000-level words can be consulted via a gloss). A vocabulary size test indicated that the participants' level of proficiency in French, the L2 of this study, was intermediate.</p> <p>We selected an authentic French clip (20') but added a manipulated version of the voice-over. This was necessary to include 15 pseudowords, i.e., the targets for incidental learning. Pseudowords were controlled for context, frequency of occurrence (N=2 per pseudoword), and word length, and consisted of 10 nouns and 5 verbs, which is in accordance with the 5:2 ratio in the 4000-5000 word frequency band (Lonsdale & Le Bras, 2009). Five surprise vocabulary tests were administered as immediate (immediately after watching the clip) and delayed (3 weeks later) posttests. Explicit knowledge of the targets was probed using a meaning recall (provide L1 translation) and meaning recognition test (select correct L1 translation). Tacit knowledge was examined by means of a spoken and written lexical decision task (timed word vs. non-word judgments) and a semantic priming task (timed semantic relatedness judgments).</p> <p>We predict that the types of subtitles will affect form and meaning-related aspects of lexical knowledge differently. While we expect that L2 subtitles will be most effective for developing form-related knowledge, we predict that L1 subtitles as well as L2 subtitles with access to meaning will be most beneficial for meaning-related aspects. By using both explicit and psycholinguistic measures of word knowledge, this study may refine our understanding of the merits of enhanced audio-visual input for lexical acquisition.</p> <p>Lonsdale,D., & LeBras, Y.

<p><span>There is a long tradition of research on the relation between bilingualism and academic achievement. Generally there is now an agreement that bilingualism does not have negative effects on cognitive development and a large number of studies show that bilinguals outperform monolinguals in a variety of verbal and non-verbal tasks (for an overview see Barac and Bialystok, 2011). There is also a widely accepted assumption that proficiency scores in the two (or more) languages of a bilingual are related (Common Underlying Proficiency Hypothesis, Cummins 1980), and that support in one language will be beneficial for the other language as well (Developmental Interdependence Hypothesis, Cummins 1979). In the present study we investigate the relation between the vocabulary knowledge of bilingual children in both of their languages and the relation of non-verbal intelligence scores and vocabulary knowledge. In addition we investigate the role that language dominance preferences of the parents might have on the development of vocabulary and IQ scores of bilingual children. The participants in the present study are 100 Turkish-English bilingual children (age range 7 - 11) who grew up in the UK. The parents were all immigrants to the UK from Turkey and at least one of them had an academic degree. The findings of our study can therefore only be representative for bilingual families with a certain Socio-Economic Status. We used a receptive vocabulary test in both languages (X-Lex; Meara and Milton 2003), a productive vocabulary test in both languages (a verbal fluency task), a non-verbal intelligence test (Raven, Raven and Court, 1998) and a questionnaire about language dominance (Dunn and Fox Tee, 2009). The vocabulary and IQ tests were administrated to the children, the dominance questionnaire to the parents. Our findings show that there is a clear relation between vocabulary scores in both languages. Children with a large vocabulary in Turkish will also have a larger vocabulary in English (receptive vocabulary: r = .61, p <.01; productive vocabulary: r = .74, p < .01). The receptive vocabulary and the IQ scores are also significantly related. A partial correlation controlling for age yields: IQ/Turkish receptive vocabulary (r = .47, p < .001) and IQ/English receptive vocabulary scores r = .56, p < .001). The language dominance of the parents has a clear influence on the vocabulary and intelligence scores of the children. Turkish dominance of parents and children's IQ scores are significantly positive related ( r = .54, p < .01). Our study shows that there is clear evidence for the Common Underlying Proficiency Hypothesis in the area of vocabulary knowledge. Furthermore, we conclude that non-verbal IQ and vocabulary knowledge are related, and that a positive attitude of the parents towards the minority language in an immigration setting (Turkish in this case) has a positive effect on vocabulary knowledge in both languages and on non-verbal IQ scores. One question for further research is whether we can identify a psychological trait that underlies vocabulary knowledge and non-verbal IQ scores for both, bilingual and monolingual children.</span></p> <p><span>References:</span></p> <p><span>Barac, R. & Bialystok, E.

<p>Recently, more studies have started to investigate vocabulary acquisition through viewing audio-visual input (Montero-Perez et al., 2014; Rodgers, 2013; van Zeeland & Schmitt, 2013; Vidal, 2011). These studies have demonstrated that it is indeed possible to learn new words when watching television and videos, although the learning gains tend to be low. Research has also explored variables that might increase vocabulary learning through audio-visual input. Studies have indicated that part of speech (Van Zeeland & Schmitt, 2013), frequency of occurrence (Rodgers, 2013; Van Zeeland & Schmitt, 2013, Vidal, 2003), and vocabulary size (Montero-Perez et al., 2014) affect the chances of a word being learned. One factor which is yet to be examined is a word's relevance to understanding the video. </p> <p>The aim of this study is to investigate English-as-a-Foreign-Language learners' acquisition of three aspects of vocabulary knowledge through viewing a television program: form recognition, meaning recall, and meaning recognition. Specifically, this study explores (a) the effect of a word's frequency of occurrence, (b) the effect of a word's relevance, (3) the effect of Part of Speech and (4) the mediating role of learners' vocabulary size on incidental vocabulary acquisition. A secondary aim is to determine how a combination of the aforementioned factors might affect vocabulary learning through watching television.</p> <p>An ecologically-valid study was set up in which participants watched a video that was directly related to their course aims. Whereas previous studies have generally used short videos, this study used a one-hour television program. A pretest-posttest-delayed posttest design was adopted. The participants, 70 Dutch-speaking EFL university students, were assigned to an experimental group that watched the video, or to a control group that received no input and only took the vocabulary tests. The video contained 64 target words. They differed in terms of frequency of occurrence (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), in perceived relevance, and in part of speech (noun, verb, adjective). Vocabulary gains were measured in a form recognition test, a meaning recall test and a meaning recognition test.</p> <p>Preliminary analyses indicated that the experimental group learned significantly more words than the control group in the meaning recall test, recalling on average the meaning of 4.5 words (16% relative gain). However, no significant difference was found in the form recognition test and in the meaning recognition test. Significant correlations were found (a) between frequency and meaning recognition and meaning recall and (b) between relevance and meaning recognition and meaning recall. Part of speech only affected gains in the meaning recognition test. Finally, participants' vocabulary size positively affected learning gains in the meaning recall and meaning recognition test.</p> <p>The results indicate that vocabulary may be learned incidentally through watching a single television program in the same way that relatively small vocabulary learning gains occur through reading a single text. The pedagogical implications of the findings will be discussed in detail.</p>

<p>Recent findings suggest that access to contextual information affects the perception and production of L2 intonation [3]. Here we seek to determine to what extent increasing contextual information affects the perception and production of English statements, absolute yes-no questions (AQs) and declarative questions (DQs) by speakers of a tonal language (Mandarin). In Mandarin, AQs and DQs are syntactically identical; questions are marked by either a rising boundary tone and the presence of a sentence-final lexical marker (ma) or by the Verb-not-Verb structure [1]. When compared to English controls, learners are expected to (i) demonstrate more difficulty with questions than statements; (ii) produce a larger pitch range in the nuclear rise in questions; (iii) display larger differences in tasks with more contextual information.</p> <p>We compared English controls (N=10) to L1 Mandarin advanced learners of English (N=15; AoA= 18.1; LoR=2.1) across perception and production experiments in which access to contextual information was manipulated. The former included a low-pass filter sentence identification task, a decontextualized sentence-identification task and a contextualized matching task. Production experiments involved a de-contextualized sentence-repetition task and a context-completion task. Mean accuracy rates and reaction times (RTs) were analysed for the perception data. For the production data, the first pitch accent (PA) and the nuclear contour (NC) (final PA plus boundary tone) were analysed acoustically (F0 changes).</p> <p>Results revealed larger differences in production than in perception. In the repetition task, phonetic differences were restricted to the PA realization. Learners closely resembled controls but they displayed more frequent use of PAs, consistent with previous findings [4]. In the contextualized production task, L1 Mandarin speakers showed a larger pitch excursion in the realization of the NC than controls, both in AQs (F(1,12)=22.6; p=.0001) and DQs (F(1,12)=26.7; p=.000). In perception (against our predictions), groups did not significantly differ across tasks in mean accuracy rates but learners showed significantly longer RTs in the de-contextualized task (F(1,20)=7.9; p=.005).</p> <p>As in previous studies [2], results revealed cross-linguistic influence in the realization of phonetic parameters in both types of questions (size of the F0 excursion in NCs), with larger differences in contextualized tasks. Thus, increasing contextual information affects perception and production differently. While no significant effects were observed in perception, groups showed larger differences in the realization of NCs in the contextualized task, and in the realization of PAs in the repetition task. The findings suggest that, as with segments, the acquisition of intonation is modelled by typological differences, contextual effects and the specific target structure to be acquired.</p> <p> </p> <p>References:</p> <p>Liu, F, Xu, Y. 2005.

<p>The general aim of this study is to investigate the similarities and differences in processing Japanese passive constructions by heritage speakers and advanced second language (L2) learners of Japanese. These groups acquire the language differently in terms of age and context/manner of acquisition, and may therefore display differences in linguistic knowledge and processing of the three Japanese passives: 1) niyotte passive; 2) ni-direct passive; 3) indirect passive. The latter two involve syntax-semantics-discourse interface, whereas the former does not. It has been found that advanced heritage speakers and L2 learners face difficulties in mastering the complicated structures involving different structural levels, especially structure interfacing with discourse (Laleko & Polinsky 2013; Montrul & Polinsky 2011 among many others). It is argued that the interface involving an external cognitive domain (e.g., syntax-discourse) requires more processing than a linguistic sub-components interface (e.g., syntax-semantics) (Sorace 2011). </p> <p>However, previous studies of acquisition of Japanese passives by both L1 and L2 learners have shown contrary results, with the niyotte passive, which does not involve an external interface, being acquired later than the other two passives, which are discourse dependent (Harada & Fukuda 1998 for L1; Hara 2002 for L2). These results may be attributed to syntax derivation or frequency of use. The niyotte passive is derived by movement, while the other two are base-generated. The complexity of the syntactic derivation may delay the acquisition. Also, usage of niyotte passive is usually limited to formal speech or written texts.</p> <p>Acquisition of Japanese passives will allow us to analyse the factors that play a crucial role, and which may be a burden to acquisition. In order to investigate these factors, two tasks will be employed: 1) acceptability judgement task; 2) self-paced listening task. The former will investigate knowledge of each type of Japanese passives by heritage speakers and L2 learners. The latter will allow us to test whether there are any differences in the processing of different types of passives; i.e. whether the passives with external interface are harder for L2 learners and heritage speakers to process. A control group of native speakers will be tested to compare their results to those of the two experimental groups, which will lead to find out whether heritage speakers have similar knowledge and processing patterns to the control group than their counterparts due to their early exposure to the language.</p> <p> </p> <p>References:</p> <p>Hara, M.

<p>Language analytical ability which is an encapsulated single label composed of inductive language analytical ability and grammatical sensitivity by Skehan (1989) has been predominant in many aptitude tests in the field of second language acquisition (SLA), the LLAMA language aptitude test developed by Meara (2005) being no exception. A recent exploratory validation study of LLAMA (Granena, 2013) reported two dimensions under aptitude construct: implicit language aptitude represented by LLAMA D (sound recognition) and explicit language aptitude represented by LLAMA B (rote memory), LLAMA E (sound-letter correspondence), and LLAMA F (grammatical sensitivity). LLAMA has been used in a number of studies in the field of SLA; however, it would still benefit from further validation studies providing primarily qualitative insight with respect to its underlying structure and the cognitive processes employed by the test takers considering the scarcity of qualitative studies that investigate the nature of aptitude test.</p> <p>The present study is an attempt to examine the construct validity of the LLAMA language aptitude test, particularly three LLAMA subtests claimed to tap explicit language aptitude, by using introspective methodology as means of accessing the cognitive processes/strategies deployed by instructed second language (L2) learners. A total of twenty university level students with an advanced English (L2) proficiency level participated in the study. They were asked to complete the LLAMA language aptitude test while simultaneously verbalizing their thoughts. The data was transcribed verbatim and the list of cognitive processes/strategies representative of explicit language aptitude was identified. The verbal protocols of participants in this study confirmed the “explicit” nature of cognitive processes involved during task completion. The analysis showed instances of induction and associative learning such as figuring out rules and relations as well as some instances of memorization of exemplars. The qualitative findings of the study will be discussed in relation to the theoretical construct of aptitude.</p> <p> <strong>References</strong></p> <p>Granena, G. (2013).

<p>The role of gender in language learning motivation has not been extensively researched, despite the fact that there seem to exist deeply rooted stereotypes suggesting that languages are considered a feminine domain (Norton & Pavlenko, 2004). The few studies from applied linguistics that examined gender reported that indeed female students are more motivated to learn English than their male peers (Bacon & Finneman, 1992; Bartram, 2006; Dörnyei & Csizér, 2002; Gardner & Lambert, 1972; Ryan, 2009). Sunderland (2004; in Carr & Pauwels, 2005) commented that lack in interest in language learning displayed by boys appears to be widely accepted as 'how it is' and few attempts have been made to critically analyse it (p. 21). Indeed, this appears to be the case in motivational research as the previously quoted studies offered little in the way of explanation of the reported gender differences.<br />In this study, a mixed-methods approach has been employed in order to examine the role of gender in language learning motivation and proficiency. 599 Polish learners of English aged 15-16 completed a motivational questionnaire, which included scales of the ideal L2 self, self-regulation, intrinsic motivation, instrumental orientation, international orientation, self-efficacy beliefs and English self-concept. Out of 599 participants filling in the motivational questionnaire, 398 completed the Quick Oxford Placement Test. Moreover, 20 students participated in semi-structured interviews. The quantitative data was analysed using factor analysis, MANOVA, t-tests, Structural Equation Modelling (SEM), and Wald tests, while the interviews were transcribed and coded.<br />The results of MANOVA confirmed that there was a significant difference between males and females in terms of their overall motivation (Pillai's trace = .102, F = 7.44, p < .001) and the effect size was moderate (partial eta squared = .102). Furthermore, three significant differences were detected on individual scales, namely ideal L2 self, self-regulation and international orientation. In all cases, female participants scored higher than their male peers. The effect sizes were small. The result of the t-test showed that there was a small significant difference between the scores on the proficiency test according to gender, with female participants scoring higher than their male peers. The SEM models of language learning motivation fitted separately for male and female learners were also found to be significantly different (χ² = 592 on 191 df (p < .001)). In particular, the Wald test revealed that the weight of the link between L2 self and intrinsic motivation was significantly stronger in the case of male than female students. The interviewees provided a number of potential reasons behind the higher motivation of female as compared to male learners. Among them were gender differences in employment, perceived maturity, preferred learning styles and perceived difficulty of language studies.</p>

<p>In his review of L2 English studies testing the Aspect Hypothesis (AH), Shirai (2004) concluded that studies adopting paper-and-pencil tests more consistently supported the predictions of the AH than production tasks (both oral and written). In this study we compare sixty L2 Spanish learners' (English L1) performance on three oral production tasks with increasingly controlled structure (personal interview, semi-controlled impersonal narrative, fully-controlled impersonal narrative) and a context-dependant preference (comprehension) task. Together the tasks were designed to a) force learners to produce more non-prototypical (telic-imperfective and atelic-perfective) pairings, and b) test both knowledge of (aspectual) morphological distinctions as well as distribution of use.</p> <p> Our results show that learners' use and distribution of verbal forms was not consistent across the production tasks. The less constrained task (interview) elicited the fewer non-prototypical pairings, supporting the AH. However, the more controlled tasks were successful in eliciting non-prototypical pairings which disconfirmed the AH. We argue that the combined results from the four tasks do not support the prediction that the preterit is more often used with telic predicates and the imperfect with atelic predicates, since when given the opportunity, as in our controlled impersonal narrative, all learners are able to use the preterit with states and activities, and the imperfect with accomplishment and achievements, including the beginners. Furthermore, learners are able to appropriately reject the preterit in imperfect (habitual, progressive and continuous) contexts regardless of the lexical aspectual properties of the predicate as shown in our comprehension task.</p> <p> We claim that the predictions of the AH are difficult to hold for data elicited through a battery of tasks and that the construction of a learner corpus consisting of multiple tasks by the same learners is indispensable for eliciting robust linguistic evidence that can be useful for SLA theorizing and hypothesis testing.</p>

<p>Listening to a second language (L2) is often a difficult task. Deciding where one word ends and the next begins is a non-trivial task even in one's first language, but can be particularly problematic when “listening to a second language through the ears of a first” (Cutler, 2001). Furthermore, if speech is not appropriately segmented, comprehension is likely to be compromised. In this study, we focus on proposals that simultaneous presentation of aural and orthographic information in the same language (as in when watching a television programme with teletext subtitles; henceforth ‘bi-modal input') could help L2 learners to better hear what is being said and develop their listening abilities (Vanderplank, 1988).</p> <p>In Experiment 1, we investigated whether bi-modal input could help a population of L2 users who normally fail to segment 30-40% of speech improve their ability to hear what is being said. Forty-eight international students in UK higher education underwent a 4-week pretest-treatment-posttest experiment. During the treatment (weeks 2&3), they watched English documentaries either with sound and subtitles (bi-modal group), with sound but not subtitles (no-subtitles control), or with subtitles but without sound (no-sound control). Their segmentation abilities were tested each week using the shadowing task adopted from Mitterer and McQueen (2009): each participant heard short, pause-bound utterances (e.g. “had-been-closed”) which they had to immediately repeat. Test items consisted of a) utterances previously heard; b) utterances from the same documentary not previously heard; c) utterances from another (unseen) documentary, spoken by speakers of a similar accent (British English). The number of correctly repeated words was counted for each utterance and turned into proportion scores.</p> <p>Mixed design ANOVAs, with time as a within-subject and group as a between-subject factor, revealed that the participants in the bi-modal group improved more than the controls in their ability to segment speech. Crucially, this included not only previously encountered utterances, or different utterances by the same speaker, but also utterances from programmes and speakers to which they had not been exposed, demonstrating the generalisation of learning.</p> <p>One question arising from Experiment 1 was whether the observed improvement in speech segmentation would also have an impact on speech comprehension. Listening comprehension is a complex process, and the use of top-down listening strategies, such as informed guessing or the use of context, could compensate for some problems in low-level signal processing (Vandergrift, 2003).</p> <p>Experiment 2 was of a broadly similar design as Experiment 1, but we tested both the participants' segmentation abilities on the shadowing task, and their listening comprehension by using the Cambridge Advanced English exam. Thirty-two participants from the same population took part, divided into a bi-modal and no subtitles group. A strong correlation was found between speech segmentation and listening comprehension results, and the bi-modal group improved more both in their ability to segment speech (previously heard and new) and in their ability to answer comprehension questions. The results, thus, support the view that bi-modal input contributes not only to the development of L2 speech segmentation but to better comprehension, as well.</p>

On peut, dans un premier temps, décider d'ignorer ce « déjà-là » ou d'en tenir compte; on peut ensuite, si l'on accepte de reconnaitre la réalité de sa présence, tenter de l'évacuer de la classe de langue étrangère à cause de ses effets « négatifs » sur la langue cible, ou on peut, à l'inverse, s'appuyer sur les acquis des apprentissages de la langue maternelle pour accéder à une langue étrangère (Castellotti, 2001:7). Pour nous, ce « déjà-la » représente les stratégies discursives inhérentes dans les traditions africaines orales qui peuvent être transférées par des apprenants dans l'acquisition d'une langue étrangère.</p> <p>Suivant ce raisonnement, à l'aide de notre corpus, nous tenterons de montrer que les compétences langagières dont font preuve ces étudiants en situation de plurilinguisme, notamment dans leur façon de raisonner à travers des textes argumentatifs, reflètent le mode de raisonnement et la logique de l'espace culturel d'où ils proviennent. Après une observation rapide de ces productions écrites de ces étudiants on se rend compte qu'il y a déjà des compétences discursives à l'œuvre dans ces productions. Quelques précédés oraux qu'emploient les étudiants sont: le dialogue, les métaphores culturelles, la répétition, des questions rhétoriques, appel et réponse. Nous pensons qu'au lieu d'invalider les productions argumentatives de ces étudiants, qui semblent ne pas respecter les normes occidentales du genre argumentatif, ces compétences pourraient être utiles dans l'acquisition des compétences discursives en FLE. Ainsi, ces compétences déjà acquises serviraient de tremplin vers l'acquisition d'une meilleure compétence discursive en situation d'apprentissage d'une nouvelle langue. Une didactique du FLE en situation plurilingue pourrait s'appuyer sur ces stratégies discursives.</p>

<p><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Vocabulary knowledge is a key predictor of listening and speaking success in a foreign language. On the basis of foreign language learners' performance on vocabulary measures, it is possible to classify them into language proficiency levels, as defined by the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR). The language-neutral CEFR is a highly influential document for educational language policy in Europe. It describes communicative language activities and competences and links them to six levels of language proficiency (from A1 to C2). However, the CEFR has been criticized for not being underpinned by a language proficiency theory and for being empirically insufficiently validated.</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> In general, the relationship between communicative language activities described by CEFR, especially in the domain of listening and speaking, and language competences, more specifically lexical competence, has been little investigated neither for native speakers nor for foreign language learners.</span></span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The aim of this project is to provide empirical evidence for the concept of native speakers' and foreign language learners' language proficiency by focusing on French lexical competence in listening and speaking activities as described by the CEFR for the B1 level. To make this theoretical aim possible, we will develop a mixed method approach (corpus-based and rater-based), integrating contextualized frequency counts. We will collect existing subtitle corpora and spoken native speaker language corpora. This approach will result in </span><span style="font-size: medium;">(semi)-authentic spoken French language of native speakers to which learners will be exposed when engaging in</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> </span><span style="font-size: medium;">communicative activities related to the B1 CEFR-level.</span></span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Specifically, this PhD project consists of four studies. First we will determine which vocabulary native speakers use in communicative activities at the B1 CEFR-level. Next, we will test Jan Hulstijn's language proficiency theory by empirically validating his concept of Basic Language Cognition. Hulstijn argues that there will be hardly any lexical variability between native speakers with different educational backgrounds when engaging in Basic Language Cognition activities. Hulstijn hypothesizes that Basic Language Cognition comes close to the B1 CEFR-level, which explains our focus on this level. </span><span style="font-size: medium;">Once native speakers' shared vocabulary has been identified, it is possible to determine how much lexical knowledge should be minimally attainable by French-as-a-foreign-language learners in B1 communicative situations.

<p>L'un des aspects travaillés dans le domaine de la variation stylistique porte sur les facteurs qui influent sur le choix des variantes sociolinguistiques par les locuteurs. Ces aspects explorent aussi comment les locuteurs perçoivent le sens social (« relâché », « jeune », « méridional ») des variations sociolinguistiques au sein de leur communauté. En langue seconde, des chercheurs comme Van Compernolle (2013), Regan (1995, 1996, 1997), Regan & Dewaele (2012), Howard (2004), Mougeon et al. (2002) et Paternostro (2014) se sont tournés vers la production des apprenants pour mieux comprendre le processus d'acquisition de la variation stylistique. Ils ont constaté que les allophones utilisent généralement un style beaucoup plus formel que les natifs. Les raisons de cet écart sont expliquées, par exemple, par l'input formel en classe de langue étrangère (Mougeon et al., 2002) ou par les contraintes syntaxiques de la langue cible (Howard, 2004).</p> <p>Toutefois, ces recherches centrées sur la production ne montrent pas la façon dont les apprenants perçoivent le style en langue cible, ni la façon dont ils construisent des représentations cognitives de ce style. En utilisant le phénomène de restauration stylistique, déjà attesté chez les natifs par Buson et al. (2014), nous voulons montrer que des apprenants sinophones et anglophones possèdent des schémas cognitifs qui classent les variantes formelles et non formelles dans deux catégories différentes. Nous avons proposé le protocole expérimental de Buson et al. (2014) à 67 étudiants sinophones et anglophones (niveaux B1 à C2 au CECRL) en séjour universitaire à Grenoble. Les apprenants écoutaient individuellement des énoncés formels et informels enregistrés par une locutrice native. Ces énoncés étaient soit composés de traits stylistiquement homogènes (une phrase au lexique formel contenant un trait formel comme le ne de négation) soit de traits non homogènes (une phrase au lexique formel contenant un trait non formel comme la suppression du ne de négation).</p> <p>Lorsqu'on demande à ces apprenants de répéter des énoncés stylistiquement non homogènes, ils ont tendance à rendre le style homogène en restaurant les traits cohérents avec le reste de l'énoncé (répéter l'énoncé au lexique formel en restituant la négation ne). Comme chez les natifs, ce phénomène de restauration stylistique suggère que des schémas stylistiques cohérents sont disponibles chez des allophones. Le degré individuel de restauration des apprenants n'est pas statistiquement lié à la proportion de partenaires français dans leur réseau social en France, contrairement à nos attentes. Toutefois, il existe un lien entre ce degré de restauration et le temps d'étude dans la langue cible ou la durée des séjours en France. Ainsi, les apprenants les plus exposés au français semblent avoir construit des schémas cognitifs du style plus homogènes, semblables à ceux des natifs</p> <p>La discussion portera sur la part respective de l'enseignement et du réseau social amical dans la construction des schémas stylistiques. </p>

<p><span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 12pt;">This paper is situated in the burgeoning field of Study Abroad research which explores the impact on L2 processes and outcomes of the supposedly rich naturalistic exposure afforded to L2 learners in the foreign language classroom who spend a sojourn in the target language community. In the case of grammatical development, findings are oftentimes mixed, with some studies pointing to significant benefits compared to learners who do not venture abroad, such as Howard (2001), Llanes & Muñoz (2014), Pérez Vidal & Juan-Garau (2011), while others fail to find such beneficial effects, such as Collentine (2004), Freed (1991). Various hypotheses are forthcoming to explain such discrepancies in findings, especially relating to effect of the proficiency level, duration of stay abroad, as well as the type of analysis undertaken in terms of whether it attempted to capture grammatical development as a single test score, such as in relation to complexity and accuracy or whether it offered more fine-grained exploration into the development that might occur depending on the type of analysis applied, e.g. with a focus on a specific component of the learner's grammatical repertoire, as opposed to grammatical development as a whole entity, and using different measures of development. </span></p> <p><span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 12pt;">Against this background, this study attempts to capture the role of such factors by presenting findings from a longitudinal study of 9 Anglophone university learners of French at different stages within the advanced learner variety (see Bartning 1997, 2008). Data were collected at three different times over the course of a year through extensive oral conversations. The data were analysed quantitatively in relation to different conceptual entities relating to verb, nominal and adjectival morphology, namely the expression of past time, aspect, futurity, conditionality, modality, number, person, and gender, thereby allowing more fine-grained detail to illuminate grammatical development through a multidimensional conceptual prism. Moreover, the longitudinal nature of the data, as well as the fact that the learners differed in their initial proficiency level at the outset of the study allow for interesting correlation with differences in how development may differ across the different components of the learners' grammatical repertoire. Findings suggest that grammatical development is by no means a uniform phenomenon in a study abroad context, but rather some components develop more than others in terms of a distinction between marked versus unmarked items, with an important correlation for the time at which the data collection occurred, as well as the learners' initial proficiency level.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;"> </span><span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;">As the first comprehensive study of a range of grammatical conceptual entities for the same learner cohort within a single project on study abroad, the findings will be discussed in terms of their implications for the role of learning context in relation to study abroad within a theory of Second Language Acquisition, as well as methodological issues in the study of grammatical development during study abroad. Taken together, the findings highlight the complexity of capturing grammatical development during study abroad, and thereby, underscore the limitations of previous research in terms of the potential conclusions that they provide.</span></p>

<p>Despite the substantial progress in research on how bilinguals/L2 users structure information about motion events during linguistic encoding, very little research exists addressing underlying conceptual representation of motion in the bilingual mind. Previous findings show that speakers of languages like Swedish and German preferentially encode the endpoint (goal) of events to a greater extent than speakers of languages like English and Spanish because of cross-linguistic differences in aspectual marking between these groups of languages. We study conceptual organization in German-English early and late bilinguals by manipulating contextual variation and verbal interference in two non-verbal motion categorical perception tasks asking participants to judge the similarity between clips based on the degree of endpoint salience. In the first experiment, a contextual variation effect was found in late bilinguals, such that those tested in an all-German context behaved more like German monolinguals, whereas those tested in an all-English context behaved more like English monolinguals. Early bilinguals displayed intermediate behaviour in relation to their monolingual peers regardless of testing context. In the second experiment, bilinguals were asked to perform the categorization task with concurrent verbal interference in each of their two languages. Early bilinguals were unaffected by the language of interference, displaying similar behaviour across the two conditions. Late bilinguals displayed categorization behaviour that was the opposite of that of the language of interference. Such an effect has not been found before, and establishes the hypothesis that bilinguals who learned their languages early in life utilize a common conceptual store of merged concepts, whereas bilinguals who learned their languages later in life have distinct, language-specific conceptual systems.</p> <p><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;"> </span></p> <p> </p>

<p>Learning a language and playing music may engage similar domain-general mechanisms. Word learning, for example, requires sound perception and discrimination, attention, association of concepts to speech sounds and storing of associations in memory – a multi-functional task relying on processes that are also required when playing an instrument. Moreover, there is evidence for overlapping brain regions involved in language and music processing and that musicianship positively impacts on the neuronal networks underlying these processes. Based on these previous findings, the aim of the present study was to determine whether music training positively influences word learning and to specify the spatio-temporal dynamics and neurobiological basis of such transfer effects.</p> <p>We compared children (8 to 11 year-old) with and without music training when learning the meaning of new auditory words through a series of experiments: first an identification task of 6 syllables, some belonging to the French phonemic repertory (e.g., Ba, Pa) and others not (e.g., Baa, Pha), second a training session in which each syllable was associated to a picture, third a matching task with correct and incorrect picture-syllable (word) associations and finally a semantic task to test for generalization to new pictures. We recorded the Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) to examine the N1 component, related to auditory perception and attention, the N2 component, related to categorization, the N4 component, considered as the brain signature of lexical and semantic processing, and the Late Positive Component (LPC), taken as a marker of episodic memory traces, context updating and decision-related processes.</p> <p>Clearly, results showed that music training facilitated syllabic identification; this influence was larger for syllables that did not belong to the French phonemic repertory, thereby supporting the idea that musical expertise may benefit second language acquisition. All children were able to learn the meaning of new words in the short time of the experiment (i.e., 2 hours). Importantly, children with music training learned the new words more efficiently than children without music training, as shown by higher level of performance in the matching and semantic tasks. These results were also evident in faster and stronger brain plasticity in “musicians” than in control children: fronto-centrally distributed N2 and N4 in the training session, indicating word-categorization and association processes shifting to parietal N2 and N4 effects in the matching and semantic tasks, reflecting access to semantic memory networks.</p> <p>Taken together, these results demonstrate fast and strong neural plasticity in the child brain and highlight the influence of musical training on speech perception as well as on higher cognitive functions, so that enhanced auditory perception and attention with music training is associated with better phonological representations, memory and word learning. Of specific interest is the potential of active music training to boost neural mechanisms underlying language-related skills, which are critical for children's education and for language acquisition, not only of the mother tongue but also of foreign languages.</p>

<p>This contribution considers the development of clause linking in both French and English as second languages. While clause linking and other indicators of syntactic complexity have been studied extensively, both from a descriptive and from an acquisitional perspective (Diessel & Tomasello 2001, Giacalone Ramat 1999, Benazzo 2004), most studies so far do not offer a unified, theoretically motivated view of clause linking mechanisms as a whole or of their relative distribution in language use. The present contribution proposes a detailed analysis of a wide range of inter- and intraclausal linkage types, focusing not only on the syntactic but equally on the semantic side of clause combination. It states, in particular, that the acquisition of relations between clauses and predicates depends on the relative complexity of the elements combined.</p> <p>This study classifies clause links according to the framework of Role and Reference Grammar (RRG; Van Valin & LaPolla 1997, Van Valin 2005), a unified theory of language claiming to be universally applicable and emphasizing the interaction of syntax and semantics, which finds itself represented in the case of clausal complexity in the form of a number of hypotheses tested here. In the first place, inter- and intraclausal relations are expected to be of equal syntactic and semantic strength (according to the Interclausal Relations Hierarchy, Van Valin 2005). Where one type of semantic connection can be encoded in different syntactic ways, the first combination to be acquired should be the one where semantic and syntactic strength are more or less equal. At an intra-clausal level (regarding the combination of predicates and their arguments within a single clause), the first junctures to be acquired should be semantically ‘strong', whereas the first junctures to arise at the interclausal level (combining multiple clauses into a sentence) should be semantically ‘weaker' in nature.</p> <p>These hypotheses are tested on French and English L2 data, more precisely semi-spontaneous oral retellings (frog stories, Mayer 1969) produced by Belgian adolescents from 11 to 18 years of age, all speakers of Dutch as a native language. Their narratives are compared to those of equally adolescent native speakers of both languages.</p> <p>Initial results suggest that the proposed match in terms of semantic and syntactic strength is confirmed by the data at hand, and that those linkage types characterized by a syntax-semantics mismatch are indeed acquired at a later stage. The more specific hypotheses regarding the intra- and the interclausal level equally appear to be confirmed, though the range of linkage types used by the learners is not always wide enough to allow for definitive conclusions. </p>

<p>Researching the development of English language proficiency with young learners (YLs) has gained currency as a younger age of learning English as a second language has been introduced in a range of countries around the world (Enever, 2011; Eurydice, 2005). Though there is a substantial body of research literature on the acquisition of vocabulary (Broady, 2008; Schmitt, 2008), these studies reveal a paucity of research in which the development of YLs' lexical competence has been investigated. While the use of assessment for learning (AfL) is reported to have profound effects on learning outcomes in mainstream education (Black & Wiliam, 1998; Wiliam et al., 2004) there is little research investigating the impact AfL would have on the development of vocabulary in a second language among YLs. </p> <p>A recent mixed-methods study in the Netherlands aimed at filling this gap. The quantitative study used a quasi-experimental design to examine the effects of AfL on learners' acquisition of L2 vocabulary knowledge. The 97 participants were Dutch native speakers in four matched classes in the first form of secondary education. (Two classes formed the experimental group, the other two classes the control group). The strength of the learners' vocabulary knowledge was tested, before and after the intervention. Adapted from Laufer et al. (2004), the test was designed for YLs with lexical items from their curriculum. The AfL techniques used in the experimental group created opportunities for learners to engage with lexical items in different (meaningful) ways (cf. Broady, 2008) promoting “depth of processing” (cf. Craik & Lockhart, 1972). Learner diaries and the teacher's reflective journal comprised the qualitative data.</p> <p>Preliminary results of the study clearly suggest that young learners are able to use AfL techniques and that it benefits their development of vocabulary knowledge. Learners in the intervention group had higher scores for their tests of vocabulary strength, and results from the qualitative study indicate that learners believed that the use of AfL promoted the “depth of processing” of the vocabulary. These findings have significant implications for classroom teachers and for teacher training programmes.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>References</strong></p> <p>Black, P., & Wiliam, D.

The results show that the ability to use the input prime sentence for learning was different depending on previous experience as expressed by proficiency. Thus, implicit learning is more effective for higher-proficiency students, while explicit teaching has an important role for lower-proficiency students, whose syntactic structure might not be fully represented in their mental lexicon for learning grammatical rules.</span></span></p> <p><span style="font-family: 'Century',serif; font-size: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'ＭＳ 明朝'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-font-kerning: 1.0pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: JA; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"><span style="font-family: ＭＳ Ｐゴシック; font-size: medium;"> </span></span></p> <p><span><span style="font-family: Century; font-size: medium;">The above results are consistent with the previous studies of structural priming by Japanese EFL learners using dative structures in sentence completion tasks (e.g., Morishita, 2012, 2013).

<p>My contribution investigates the L2 acquisition of German gender agreement by 38 primary school pupils (age 8-10, onset of L2 with ca. 3 years) with either Turkish or Russian as their L1. Recent research on this topic has shown different sequences in the acquisition of either formal or semantic gender assignment rules (Dieser 2009, Marouani 2006, Montanari 2010, Kaltenbacher & Klages 2006, Ruberg 2013, Wegener 2000). Those results were primary based on the use of determiners while other gender sensitive targets (adjectives, relative and personal pronouns) were not investigated that well.</p> <p>Therefore, one aim of my study was to explore if either formal or semantic agreement is first marked on all different types of gender sensitive targets. The second aim was to verify possible conceptual crosslinguisitic transfer effects depending on the children's L1: Only learners with L1 Russian know the grammatical category gender from their L1, while children with L1 Turkish do not.</p> <p>The results of a written elicitation task, performed three times over the course of six months, show that the interpretation of all gender sensitive targets starts with the use of semantic strategies: At the beginning, both test groups mark semantic instead of grammatical agreement. The form-function mapping in both test groups relies on the same features: sex and animacy.</p> <p>The expected difference between the two test groups was confirmed for the onset of marking grammatical gender: Learners with L1 Russian mark grammatical gender earlier than children with L1 Turkish, presumably because of conceptual transfer from their L1.</p> <p>Furthermore, the data shows that semantic agreement appears more often on personal pronouns than on determiners, adjectives or relative pronouns.

<p>Lexical phrases (e.g., collocations and idioms) have in recent years attracted a fair amount of interest in the field of language pedagogy. SLA studies have shown phrasal lexis to benefit second (or foreign) language learners in various ways: it facilitates fluent real-time language processing, both receptive (Conklin & Schmitt, 2008) and productive (Wood, 2010), and it helps learners to produce ‘idiomatic' language instead of unconventional word strings which may hinder smooth communication (Millar, 2010). However, in the absence of massive amounts of exposure to the target language, learners tend to be very slow at developing phrasal competence (Laufer & Waldman, 2011) and initiatives to accelerate this learning process would be very welcome. Unfortunately, there is still a shortage of empirical studies of instructional methods and techniques. The present study focuses on the deliberate memorization of L2 phrases and tests the effectiveness of two proposals for how to help learners' accurately recall the lexical composition of L2 phrases. EFL learners (N = 65) studied a list of 32 figurative verb + noun-phrase expressions (e.g., turn the tide) glossed in L1. In one condition they were only instructed to study the list. In a second they were additionally instructed to identify phrases whose verb is non-congruent with the L1 translation. In a third the instruction was to identify phrases that alliterate. Both additional instructions intended to promote learners' engagement with the composition of the expressions. The 32 phrases included equal numbers of congruent and alliterative ones. It was hypothesized that the extra instructions would cause learners to pay extra notice to the choice of verbs in the phrases and would result in better recall. Comparisons of pre- to post-test gains showed that prompting learners to compare the target collocations with their L1 did not appear to be helpful in comparison with a condition where learners were left to their own mnemonic devices. On the other hand, prompting learners to look for alliteration did appear to be conducive to form retention. These results suggest that the merits of channelling learners' engagement during deliberate study may depend on the type of channelling and that not all efforts to manipulate learners' processing during a memorization task necessarily bring about better outcomes than if the learners use their own, habitual mnemonic strategies.</p> <p> </p> <p>References</p> <p>Conklin, K., & Schmitt, N.

<p>Many techniques for L2 vocabulary learning involve semantic elaboration, i.e. the increased attention to a word's meaning. Studies claim, however, that employing semantic elaboration during L2 vocabulary learning can inhibit word-form learning and it is structural elaboration, i.e. the enhanced attention to the form of a word, which helps learners to acquire the form of the new word (Barcroft 2003). In this psycholinguistic study, we aim to discover whether structural elaboration, in particular the writing of the target vocabulary, promotes English L2 word-form learning. The research design used in this study is a partial replication of Elgort's contextual word learning study (under review). Her study showed that for Chinese-speaking learners of English, writing new target vocabulary led to more robust lexical knowledge and better form-meaning mapping than guessing the target vocabulary's meaning from the context. The present study, however, was carried out with participants whose native writing system is similar to English (Roman alphabet).</p> <p> The participants were 50 Dutch speaking EFL speakers who have all had formal English instruction in secondary school. Their proficiency level varied from B2 to C2. Forty-eight new English words, of which 24 were pseudo words and 24 were low-frequency words, were presented in 3 different contexts. During the learning procedure, the participants had to write down half of these words on paper and derive the meaning of the other half from the context given. The two conditions were counterbalanced to avoid order effects. After learning the words, the participants performed a working memory test and an immediate test in which they first listened to the word, then typed the word and subsequently provided its meaning. This test measured the extent of form-meaning mapping that had occurred. One day later, they were subjected to two priming tasks to measure the amount of lexicalization that had taken place. In order to correlate lexical gains with vocabulary size, two vocabulary size tests and a productive gapfill test were administered a day after the treatment. In this last test, the participants were presented with 24 sentences, each of which was missing a newly learned word. This measure of delayed recall allowed us to discover whether the meaning of a new word activates the form of this target word. As such, it is a valuable addition to Elgort's (under review) immediate form-meaning mapping test, since form recall reflects declarative rather than implicit word knowledge.</p> <p> The results should shed more light on the value of writing as a technique for structural elaboration. A comparison between this study and Elgort's (under review) should also reveal more about the relative efficacy of writing for English L2 vocabulary acquisition for users of different writing systems.</p> <p> </p> <p>Barcroft, J.

<p>Despite the importance of mastering collocations and other types of formulaic language in order to achieve high levels of language proficiency and fluency, empirical studies exploring the acquisition of collocations are still scarce. Previous research suggests that incidental learning from reading can be an effective method of learning collocations in a foreign language (Webb & Kagimoto, 2009). However, with few studies available to date, little is known about the collocational knowledge that can be acquired incidentally from reading. In addition, earlier studies have largely used off-line measures, such as post-reading tests. Although informative, these measures tell us little about the mechanisms and processes involved in the reading of novel collocations.</p> <p>In the present study, we used a combination of off-line (pen and paper) and on-line (eye movements) measures to investigate collocation learning from reading. The aim of the study was to examine whether L2 speakers of English can incidentally acquire Adjective+Noun collocations, where the adjective is a real English word and the noun is a legal pseudoword (magic salp ‘magic ring'), as well as to explore the on-line processing of such multi-word units. Participants read a story containing six target collocations while their eye movements were recorded. The effect of frequency of exposure was examined by manipulating the number of occurrences of the collocation. Following the reading experiment, participants completed a battery of tests which assessed their knowledge of the target pseudowords as well as collocational knowledge (both recall and recognition).</p> <p>The following eye-tracking measures were examined: first fixation duration, gaze duration, total reading time, and the total number of fixations. The eye-tracking data and post-experiment test scores were compared to examine the relationship between reading times and performance in the tests (in line with Godfroid, Boers, & Housen, 2013; Williams & Morris, 2004).</p> <p>The results of the present study are discussed in the context of (1) the effect of repetition on the speed of processing, with reading times decreasing as the effect of frequency of exposure, and (2) the correlation between reading times of the target collocation and the readers' performance in the vocabulary tests, with longer reading times linked to higher test scores., The study demonstrates the application of the eye-tracking methodology not only in the exploration of incidental learning of single words (Pellicer-Sánchez, forthcoming), but also longer stretches of language. Overall, the study provides further evidence for the effectiveness of eye-tracking in the investigation of second language acquisition, in general, and incidental learning from reading, in particular.</p> <p><strong>References:</strong></p> <p>Godfroid, A., Boers, F., & Housen, A.

<p>This paper investigates imitation as opposed to audiovisual feedback in second-language speech realization of final unreleased plosives amongst French learners of English having had no prior training in that type of phonetic realization. We aim to test whether unreleasing stops increases the degree acceptability and intelligibility (Kenworthy 1989) in second language speech (Rojczyk 2013). While unreleased stops are rather frequent in French and English - especially in series of two plosives across word boundaries (Davidson 2010), unreleased plosives in final positions are less common in French (Van Dommeln 1983). We thus predict that the production of final unreleased plosives is less frequent among French students when speaking English but that an audio-visual training supplemented with a stimulus for imitation involving gestures (Kröger et al. 2010) can improve the students' pronunciations of unreleased stops. During the experiment, two groups of 20 French native speakers in their second year of English studies were asked to read idiomatic expressions in three different working environments. The sentences or expressions included both homogeneous and heterogeneous sequences of stops straddled between word boundaries, namely in sequences like “that cat” [ðæ<strong>t˺</strong> <strong>k</strong>æ<strong>t˺</strong>] and stops at the end of sentences like “I told him to speak” [tə spiː<strong>k˺</strong>]. In the second phase of the experiment, each group was given a different task to accomplish. The first group heard recorded versions of new sentences before reading them out loud. Stimuli for imitation contained no release in the contexts under scrutiny – word final and pairs of plosives straddled between words. Contrarily to the first group, the second one had to visualize a video explaining the phenomenon of unreleased stops with a production of phase-two expressions propped up by gestures and mimes. Finally, a third phase involved a second re-reading of phase-one stimuli by both groups in order to test the efficiency of shadowing versus phonetic awareness (Piske 2008). The results were then analyzed acoustically with Praat and SPPAS, and were then perceptually evaluated by native speakers of English, students in English studies in the same academic year and by francophone academic teachers of English. Using the listeners' feedbacks, the current study makes recommendations about what working environment should be prioritized in pronunciation teaching.</p> <p><strong>References:</strong></p> <p>Davidson, L.

<p>The present study will report data from a study on the acquisition, by adult L1 French and Portuguese learners, of verbal morphology in L2 Spanish; specifically focusing on the semantics and pragmatics of the simple past, present perfect, imperfect and progressive forms. Debates over the causes of optionality and inaccessibility of certain forms in L2 acquisition have dealt with the question of whether such selective difficulties are due to parametric differences between L1 and L2, whether they are permanent (Hawkins & Hattori, 2006), or whether they are symptomatic of a process of feature reassembly (Lardiere 2008). <span>Many studies have addressed the role of tense, aspect and discourse </span>in the development of verbal morphology, although little has been said on the acquisition of L2 Spanish by L1 speakers of closely related languages.</p> <p>Therefore, the study of how Spanish is acquired by speakers of French and Portuguese, whose tense/aspect systems diverge from that of Spanish, despite the fact that they share basic aspectual distinctions, represents a promising area. Are learners able to effectively transfer useful tense/aspect features from their L1? Or rather are they (mis)guided by the eventuality type when choosing a past tense (Andersen & Shirai 1996)? How does their grasp of the L2 tense/aspect distinctions and combinations develop?</p> <p>We will present original data comparing the choices of adult L1 French and L1 Portuguese speakers, learning Spanish in a non-immersion setting (Instituto Cervantes in France and Portugal) at CEFR A2 (n = 22 L1 French and 22 L1 Portuguese) and B1 (n = 24 L1 French and 24 L1 Portuguese). A control group of native Spanish speakers (n= 20) was also used. Preliminary data from more advanced learners (B2 and C1) will also be discussed, in order to offer a broader perspective.</p> <p>The participants were asked to fill 30 gaps from a narrative text in a multiple choice task (with three options per item), focusing on potentially complex uses of the Spanish past tenses, such as: choice of a perfective tense (simple past vs present perfect) in the absence of explicit time location; use of imperfect indicative with telic predicates; progressive forms (estar + gerund) combined with perfective tenses; choice of perfective or imperfective tenses with expressions denoting a time interval.</p> <p>Our results suggest that at A2 level learners are clearly influenced by the options available in their L1, but they are also influenced by discourse cues accessible in the immediate environment of a verb form; in some of the items, complex aspectual combinations are also an issue. From B1 level onwards, L1 influence is progressively attenuated, while aspectual and discourse factors tend to be more persistent. However, for Portuguese speakers, L1 direct transfer is pervasive at all levels: it has a positive effect on the choices of the A2 learners, but it often has a negative effect at more advanced levels. The study offers, thereby, data that can contribute to enhancing knowledge of factors that help and hinder the acquisition process when the L2 is closely related to the L1.</p>

<p>While traditionally, the learning of a foreign or second language (L2) has been confined to educational institutions, the present-day availability of various languages through digital media, such as film, TV, and the Internet, has opened up new venues for L2 learning to take place (<a href="file:///C:/Users/xsylli/Dropbox/Articles/Abstracts/Abstract%20for%20paper%20at%20EuroSLA_2015_.docx#_ENREF_3" target="_blank" title="Kuppens, 2010 #1085">Kuppens, 2010</a>; <a href="file:///C:/Users/xsylli/Dropbox/Articles/Abstracts/Abstract%20for%20paper%20at%20EuroSLA_2015_.docx#_ENREF_4" target="_blank" title="Piirainen-Marsh, 2009 #887">Piirainen-Marsh & Tainio, 2009</a>; <a href="file:///C:/Users/xsylli/Dropbox/Articles/Abstracts/Abstract%20for%20paper%20at%20EuroSLA_2015_.docx#_ENREF_5" target="_blank" title="Sylvén, 2012 #1374">Sylvén & Sundqvist, 2012</a>).

A way of increasing learners' exposure to and engagement with an L2 within school is content and language integrated learning (CLIL) where an L2 is used as the medium of communication in non-language subjects (<a href="file:///C:/Users/xsylli/Dropbox/Articles/Abstracts/Abstract%20for%20paper%20at%20EuroSLA_2015_.docx#_ENREF_1" target="_blank" title="Cenoz, 2013 #1548">Cenoz, Genesee, & Gorter, 2013</a>; <a href="file:///C:/Users/xsylli/Dropbox/Articles/Abstracts/Abstract%20for%20paper%20at%20EuroSLA_2015_.docx#_ENREF_2" target="_blank" title="Dalton-Puffer, 2011 #1467">Dalton-Puffer, 2011</a>). This paper investigates effects of both EE and CLIL on SLA. In a large-scale, longitudinal study CLIL (N=109) and non-CLIL (N=68) L1 Swedish students' proficiency and progress in L2 English are examined. The learners were studied during their three years in high school (school years 10-12). Various language tests, for instance reading comprehension, receptive and productive vocabulary, and writing tasks, were administered and background information, among other things details about participants' types and amount of EE, was collected. Specifically, the paper reports findings on learners' receptive and productive vocabulary and their correlation with CLIL versus non-CLIL and EE. Preliminary findings show that CLIL and non-CLIL students alike make similar progress, but CLIL students do so from a significantly higher level from the start. Furthermore, while EE seems to have an effect on students' everyday language, no such influence is apparent on their academic language skills. Pedagogical implications of these results are discussed, and future research areas for the interface of CLIL, EE and SLA suggested.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Cenoz, J., Genesee, F., & Gorter, D.

<p>The importance of teaching and learning English as a lingua franca has been recognized by many scholars and educators in ELT (e.g., Canagarajah, 1999). English language teaching practices need to keep pace, particularly in such Expanding Circle countries as Japan, where a model of instruction is primarily American English, and where linguistically homogenous students have few opportunities to encounter diverse English. Individual educators around the world, on the other hand, are beginning to raise students' awareness of English varieties, offer models of what different varieties sound like, and show how lexical or syntactic patterning vary (Jenkins, 2006; Murata & Jenkins, 2009; Seidlhofer, 2011). Yet, how to teach English in order to ensure comprehensibility among interlocutors from different L1 backgrounds is yet to be explored.</p> <p>There are two concepts that are closely related to understanding accented English: i.e., intelligibility and comprehensibility. While these two terms are sometimes used interchangeably, Smith and Nelson (1985) defined intelligibility as word/utterance recognition and comprehensibility as the understanding of word/utterance meaning. Derwing and Munro (1995) further defined comprehensibility as a listener's perception of how difficult it is to understand an utterance and the difficulty is measured using a Likert scale. The present study specifically focuses on comprehensibility of diverse English at the perceptual level as operationalized by Derwing and Munro, as well as actual comprehension assessed through a traditional style listening test.</p> <p>The study explores the relationships among perceived accentedness, perceived comprehensibility, and general English proficiency, all of which are closely related to listening to ELF. The research questions are (1) whether perceived comprehensibility is a good indicator of actual comprehension, (2) whether both higher and lower proficiency students perceive similar accentedness degrees toward the same utterances, and (3) whether perceived accentedness affects actual comprehension at every proficiency level. The participants are 100 Japanese EFL students from varying proficiency levels. They were asked to take a listening comprehension test recorded in several Outer Circle English accents, and evaluate comprehensibility and accentedness of the speakers while responding to given statements by a seven-point rating scale. The findings of this study will answer an important pedagogical question as to which proficiency level better suits for introducing multiple English accents, while contributing to wide discussions of comprehensibility in world varieties of English. </p> <p> </p> <p>References:</p> <p>Canagarajah, A.

<p>The interaction hypothesis (Long, 1996) argues that second language (L2) learning takes place especially when communication breakdown occurs during conversational interaction between non-native and native speakers, because L2 learners incidentally focus on linguistic form to retrieve comprehensibility with an aid of their interlocutors. While substantial attention has been paid to examining the role of a particular feature of interaction (e.g., interactional feedback) for promoting L2 learning, most of the previous studies have been limited to examining the role of short-term interactional intervention on L2 morphsyntactic development, often in a controlled, lab-based environment.</p> <p>By adopting a pre- and post-test design, the current study aimed to (a) re-examine whether and to what degree conversational interaction with native speakers facilitates the development of global (comprehensibility) and linguistic (pronunciation, fluency, vocabulary, grammar) aspects of spontaneous L2 speech production; and (b) how the development/non-development is related to the quality of interaction in the context of a semester-long language exchange project via video-conferencing tools, namely eTandem (i.e., a form of telecollaboration in which a pair of language learners team up and help each other teach and learn their first (or competent) and second languages</p> <p>The participants in this study were 30 American college learners of Japanese with varying proficiency levels who engaged in nine weekly, one-hour interaction sessions with native speakers of Japanese in Japan. The native speaking partners were trained and encouraged to provide recasts on Japanese learners' utterances that they thought would hinder successful comprehension. Two one-minute speech excerpts were taken from the task-based interaction, one from the second session and the other from the eighth session for each tandem pair. These samples were judged by four native speaking raters for two global constructs of L2 speech based on ease of understanding (i.e., comprehensibility) and linguistic nativelikeness (accentedness), and then submitted to pronunciation, fluency, vocabulary, and grammar analyses. The results revealed that overall comprehensibility as well as lexical richness of the elementary and intermediate learners improved. However, even within the same proficiency group, there were those who made a significant improvement and those who did not.</p> <p>In terms of the relationship between the nature of telecollaborative interaction and L2 development, approximately 15-minute interaction data from Sessions 2 and 8 were analyzed for each pair, focusing on negotiation for meaning and corrective feedback, their linguistic target (i.e., vocabulary, phonology, and grammar), and modality (i.e., oral only, text only, oral with textual enhancement). It was found that those who made a significant improvement were likely engaged in a substantial amount of multimodal interaction involving negotiation for meaning that was often triggered by lexical problems. This indicates that long-term, meaningful interaction with geographically-distant native-speaking partners facilitates L2 development. The implication for L2 research and technology-mediated language teaching will be discussed.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Long, M. H. (1996).

<p>The acquisition of additional languages may influence mature L1 systems, a phenomenon known as language attrition. Although attrition research has largely focused on the L2 influence on the L1 lexicon and syntax (Schmid 2002), additional languages arguably also affect L1 phonology (e.g. Flege 1987, Mennen 2004), even leading to perceived foreign-accentedness in the L1 (e.g. De Leeuw et al. 2010). Nevertheless, the attrition of L1 sound systems remains understudied. Furthermore, little is known about how phonological attrition may mirror timeless laws of sound change and developmental hierarchies in phonological change due to language contact.</p> <p>Rhotic sounds are known to be subject to great variation. For example, English shows variable degrees of rhoticity (full, semi- and non-rhoticity), both synchronically and diachronically. Particularly, semi-rhotic varieties with variable realizations of /r/ give reason to hypothesize that the development and loss of the postvocalic /r/ in L1 attrition may be subject to universal constraints. Ulbrich and Ordin (2014) showed that a postvocalic /r/ in the L2 can trigger the introduction of postvocalic /r/ in a non-rhotic L1. This effect, however, was only visible in certain contexts, and factors such as frequency, stress, and syllable structure were not tested. Furthermore, the directionality of sound attrition remains unknown: Can L2 non-rhoticity exert an influence on L1 rhoticity? Since rhotic sounds typologically show considerable qualitative differences, we expect to find language attrition effects also in the variable phonetic realization of /r/ (in lieu of its complete loss).</p> <p>In this study, we extend these implications and test further factors. We investigate a) whether the lack of postvocalic /r/ in the L2 can trigger the loss of rhoticity in the L1, b) which environments favor the deletion of postvocalic /r/, and c) how the L2 affects the phonetic realization of the rhotic. In our experiments, which are currently underway, 12 American English – German late bilinguals residing in Germany (LOR=10 years) perform a variety of speech elicitation tasks in both their L1 and L2. While many American English varieties are rhotic, German varieties are largely non-rhotic. The test items are mono-morphemic words, varying in the number of syllables, with the coda-/r/ occurring either after a stressed or unstressed vowel. We further control for other phonological variables such as syllable complexity and consonantal contact (homomorphemic vs heteromorphemic contexts).</p> <p>Based on observations on postvocalic /r/ in synchronic and diachronic varieties of English, we hypothesize that /r/ is more likely to undergo reduction in the unstressed condition than in the stressed condition. In stressed syllables, postvocalic /r/s preceding other consonants should be more likely to show signs of loss than those in simplex codas. Finally, the salient rhotacized vowel (ɝ) in American English should be more resistant to rhotic attrition effects than other /r/-colored vowels. Due to insufficient statistical power at this stage of our studies, we refrain from making any generalizations about our results. We will offer both qualitative and quantitative analyses of our language attrition data, informed by theoretical, typological and diachronic observations on the genesis and loss of rhoticity.</p>

<p>Almost since the beginning of second language acquisition research, there has been a strong interest in developmental stages of grammar (cf. Ellis 2015). One example of this perspective is Processability Theory (Pienemann 1998), which assumes universal developmental stages of morpho-syntactic structures. Studies of lexical development, on the other hand, have not explored developmental stages to the same extent, but they often take comparisons between native and non-native speakers as a point of departure (e.g. Meara 2009). An exception is Viberg's (1993) study on Swedish L2 vocabulary development.</p> <p> </p> <p>A large number of studies of L2 Swedish have confirmed the PT stages for morpho-syntax (e.g. Pienemann & Håkansson 1999, Håkansson & Norrby 2010, Schönström 2014). However, the stages have not been related to Swedish L2 lexical development. This paper presents the first attempt to combine levels of Processability with lexical development in Swedish.</p> <p> </p> <p>Since there are no Swedish standardized vocabulary tests, we use quantitative measures to assess the learners' vocabulary (lexical variation and lexical density). Written essays from 20 L2 learners were collected longitudinally on three occasions over 8 months (Håkansson & Norrby 2010). The lexical analysis consisted of two measures: lexical variation in type/ token and lexical density by counting the proportion of content and function words in relation to total amount of words (cf. Bardel et al 2013). The analysis of grammar relied on the Processability hierarchy.</p> <p> </p> <p>The results demonstrate a tendency for lexical variation to increase with grammatical proficiency whereas lexical density stays stable over time (cf. Johansson 2009). However, lexical variation is not only sensitive to grammatical development, but it also points to individual differences, as some learners combine a low grammatical level with high lexical variation. The results will be discussed in the light of individual differences in learner profiles.</p>

<p>The Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) has been accused both of being vague (Kuiken & Vedder 2014) and of lacking empirical underpinning (Hulstijn 2007). In this study, both language testing and language proficiency are discussed. Twenty test-takers, taking a Swedish certificate test at B2 level, were recorded. Relations between complexity, accuracy, estimated level of processability, and holistic and analytic speaking proficiency assessments were investigated, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p> <p> </p> <p>In the quantitative part of the study, seven global and local complexity and accuracy measurements from the CAF (Complexity–Accuracy–Fluency) research, were used (see Housen, Kuiken & Vedder 2012; Norris & Ortega 2009). Also, level of processability, according to the Processability theory (PT), was estimated (see Pienemann 2011). Correlation tests (Pearson's r) indicated that complexity and accuracy, to some extent, co-varied with each other, with PT level, and with holistic assessments. However, overlapping between assessed levels was large, just like in other studies (e.g. Iwashita, Brown, McNamara & O'Hagen 2008). Furthermore, the analytic grade for the ‘Formal Complexity and Accuracy' criterion co-varied foremost with global accuracy, whereas complexity measures aligned more with the ‘Pronunciation and intonation' grade. Based on these results, assessors' capacity of assessing several conceptually independent features simultaneously can be questioned.</p> <p> </p> <p>For the qualitative part of the study, four test-takers were selected. Two of these had received high grades and two had received low grades, but according to complexity and accuracy measures, one of those with high grade and one with low grade had produced the same kind of language. Nevertheless, after having examined complexity and accuracy closer, in different kinds of phrases and clauses, the assessors' decisions seemed more reasonable. Out of eight measurements used in the quantitative study, only PT level indicated a difference between these two test-takers. In the qualitative investigation, this difference became very clear. From these results, also linguistic measurements, used in the CAF research, can be criticized (cf.

<p>It is common practice for language teachers to encourage their students to actively guess the meanings of unknown words from context during reading. This approach is less time consuming than looking up words in a dictionary and less disruptive to the flow of reading. However both native and second/foreign language (L2) readers may guess word meanings incorrectly. How damaging are these incorrect inferences in vocabulary learning? In studies conducted with memory impaired (Clare & Jones, 2008; Middleton & Schwartz, 2012) and normal native-speaker participants, children and adults, results are inconsistent (Bridger & Mecklinger, 2014; Kornell, Hays, & Bjork, 2009; Warmington & Hitch, 2013; Warmington, Hitch, & Gathercole, 2013), with both errorless and errorful approaches found to be more beneficial in different studies, depending on the nature of the tasks, choice of materials, learning conditions and measures of learning. Few studies have investigated the effect of errorless learning in the L2 context, but Trenkic & Warmington (2014) found an advantage for errorless over errorful/effortful word learning, regardless of whether the participants' guesses were correct or incorrect. The present study adds to the knowledge in this area by examining the effect of correct vs. incorrect guessing of novel L2 (English) word meanings from context by adult higher-intermediate and advanced Chinese-English bilinguals.</p> <p>The study participants learned 48 novel English vocabulary items, actively guessing their meanings from context and recording their guesses. The participants encountered each novel vocabulary item in three different supportive sentence contexts. The first encounter with the critical item (accompanied by an audio recording) served as a familiarisation phase, and students were not required to record their guesses. During the second and third contextual encounters, participants had to write down an inferred meaning of the critical item. At the end of the learning cycle, participant had a chance to see the critical words with their definitions and to verify their guesses. A word dictation task (testing the knowledge of form) and a meaning generation task (testing the ability to retrieve meaning from form) were used as immediate measures of learning. A speeded lexical decision task was used as a delayed test of word knowledge, on the following day. The three measures tested whether errors in inferring word meanings from context modulated different facets of word knowledge – knowledge of spelling, form-meaning mapping, and fluency and accuracy of access to word knowledge. The data were analysed using mixed effects modeling, with participants and items treated as crossed-random effects. The experimental data analysis is supplemented with students' views on learning L2 words through contextual guessing.</p> <p>The discussion will focus on the effect of guess correctness on the learning outcome, i.e., whether incorrectly guessing the meaning of a novel L2 word inhibits its learning, and whether this effect is larger when incorrect guessing occurs on an earlier or a later encounter with the novel word. The results of this study are discussed in relation to the Lexical Quality Framework (Perfetti & Hart, 2002; Perfetti, 2007). Arguments for and against errorless learning are considered.</p>

<p><strong></strong>Written corrective feedback (CF) has received much attention over the last decades, in both the fields of (L2) writing and SLA research (e.g., Bitchener & Ferris, 2012). Two of the topics that have been explored quite extensively are the value of error correction for written accuracy development and the relative effectiveness of different CF types (e.g., Van Beuningen, De Jong, & Kuiken, 2012). Most of such CF studies, however, only focused on group results and ignored the fact that some learners benefit more from (a specific type of) written CF than others. A logical next step would be to investigate how learners' receptivity to (different types of) CF is mediated by individual characteristics, such as aptitude or motivation for language learning (e.g., Kormos, 2012). To date, only few studies have dealt with this issue, and the studies that have, only explored the influence of one individual factor in isolation (e.g., Shintani & Ellis, 2015).</p> <p>The current study tries to fill this gap by conjointly assessing the mediating role of 1) language analytical ability (i.e., a cognitive factor), 2) explicit grammar knowledge (i.e., a knowledge factor), and 3) self-efficacy beliefs, attitudes towards CF, and motivational intensity (i.e., affective factors) in learners' receptivity to two written CF types, that is direct and indirect, unfocused CF. In direct CF, a teacher provides learners with both an indication of their errors and the corresponding correct linguistic forms. In indirect CF, on the other hand, errors are indicated, but it is left to the learner himself to correct them. Unfocused or comprehensive (as opposed to focused or selective) CF involves correction of all errors in learners' writing.</p> <p>Participants in this classroom-based quasi-experiment were 150 B1-level, (young) adult learners of Dutch, from 10 different classes in 5 multi-ethnic vocational schools. They performed a pre-test writing task (week 1), a revision task (week 2), and a post-test writing task (week 3). Within each class, learners were randomly assigned to one of two groups; the first group received direct, unfocused CF, and the other group obtained indirect, unfocused CF. Error rates were calculated for the writing and revision tasks to measure learners' accuracy development. Moreover, participants were administered tests and questionnaires that tap into the aforementioned individual factors. We performed regression analyses to evaluate the mediating effect these factors have on the accuracy of learners' revised and new writing. This presentation focuses on the findings of the study and discusses the implications it has for teaching practice.</p> <p>References</p> <p>Bitchener, J., & Ferris, D. (2012).

<p>The papers in the proposed colloquium all consider questions crucial to a better understanding of cross-linguistic influence or transfer in bilinguals and L2 learners. There is still a great deal of confusion around the notions of transfer, interference, cross-linguistic influence and convergence. It is unclear to what extent these terms refer to phenomena that can be empirically distinguished from each other, and if so, which methods are most appropriate for investigating the different phenomena. The three papers focus on important issues:how the notion of transfer came into linguistic research, how statistical learning may or may not involve the native language, and how cognitive systems may or may not interact when categories in two languages are not fully congruent. Considering as it does the origins of the term transfer (and related topics), the first paper looks closely at the historiography of SLA, and it challenges several assumptions in conventional SLA historiography (e.g. the often-repeated claim that the notion of transfer has its origins in behaviourist psychology). The role of statistical learning in SLA, which is the broad theme of the second paper, must be considered not only in terms of how frequent a language structure is but also in terms of how frequent a corresponding structure in the native language or some other source language is as well; even so, the results of the second paper do not show a strong influence of frequency of motion verbs in L1 Chinese on the use of motion verbs in L2 English. The third presentation offers evidence of L1-L2 conceptual transfer, reverse transfer and the effect of linguistic relativity. It shows modifications in the cognitive systems of learners, which demonstrates the interaction between two languages (French and Spanish) that encode grammatical gender and a language (English) with natural gender marking. The colloquium brings together historical, corpus-linguistics and experimental (neuro-scientific) approaches to transfer. The general aim of this colloquium is to explore these approaches to cross-linguistic influence and stimulate discussion around them.</p>

<p>As a consequence of migration and demographic change, early L2 training programs have been enforced all across Europe. There is high political pressure for these intervention programs to be successful but the results from evaluation studies are mixed. Several studies have questioned the quality of program implementation which also challenges the competences of the caregivers or teachers involved. Theories that model language training competence claim that caregivers must have (meta-)linguistic knowledge about language as a system, about SLA and about multilingualism to effectively support L2ers' linguistic development at kindergarten age. This knowledge should combine with abilities and action repertoires so that caregivers can identify learner needs accurately and can create language learning environments. These are efficient if they emulate naturalistic and successful SLA settings.</p> <p>In this presentation, we focus on the question if caregiver language training competence promotes child L2 competence in the unstructured context of kindergarten education and present the first study that relies on standardized assessment of both competences. In a longitudinal test-retest design, we assessed the receptive and productive L2 German vocabulary and grammar of 86 children (mean age = 4;4 years, SD = 0;7) at the beginning and end of their participation in a 10 month language training program. The program was implemented by 24 members of kindergarten caretaker teams who regularly worked with small groups of about three children. The caretakers received further education to enhance their language training competence which was assessed with a standardized test. It contained 55 multiple-choice knowledge questions about language, SLA and language training as well as 18 situational judgment/ rating tasks to assess strategic and methodological abilities in the areas of language assessment and support.</p> <p>For analysis, the children's linguistic development was linearly regressed onto the caregiver's language training competence score, relevant control variables (age, age of kindergarten entry, hours of language training received, German speaking context, time between assessments) and interaction terms. The final model explained 41% of the variance in child SLA development. The variables representing language training competence were the strongest predictors of increasing child L2 competence, followed by language training quantity. We also found that the caretakers' declarative metalinguistic knowledge is a prerequisite for successful child L2 training. Yet, it is not very effective unless it is met by substantial practical implementation skills. Our findings provide empirical support for linguistically motivated models of language training competence in the context of child SLA. We argue that applied linguistics should be further strengthened in the curricula of early-years professionals to support child language learning more effectively and economically.</p>

<p>Recent research on decision making suggests that bilinguals make more rational decisions about logically identical problems if these are presented in the L2 rather than in the L1 (Costa, Foucart, Arnon, Aparici, & Apesteguia, 2014; Keysar, Hayakawa, & An, 2012). As this so called foreign language effect tends to be more pronounced in more emotional decision problems, the favored explanation for it is that the L2 provides greater emotional distance. This distance is attributed to different acquisition contexts that result in weaker links between the L2 and the emotion system. An alternative explanation is that L2 processing is less fluent and consumes more working memory capacity so that fewer resources are left for the decision making process. In monolingual contexts, decision biases have been shown to increase with working memory capacity (Corbin, McElroy, & Black, 2010). Yet, the interaction between L2 processing, working memory, emotionality and decision making has not been tested explicitly so far.</p> <p>In this talk, we report on two experiments that addressed these interactions. We investigated to what extent the foreign language effect, which is supposed to reduce the well-known framing bias in decision making, can be attributed to emotionality and working memory. Both experiments used a 2 (frame: gain vs. loss) x 2 (language: L1 German vs. L2 English) between-group design. We controlled for working memory capacity (AOSPAN), emotionality (PANAS) and L2 proficiency with standardized tests. While the decision problem was easy to read in Exp. 1, Exp. 2 degraded the presentation visually so that reading the text required additional attention and effort. For analysis, the participants were matched on working memory.</p> <p>Bivariate results from Exp. 1 (N = 114) indicate that the foreign language effect occurred: The decision bias was only significant in the L1. A multiple logistic regression analysis of the decision behavior shows, however, that working memory capacity was the only significant predictor. Language and emotionality did not make a significant contribution. Exp. 2 (N = 87) corroborated the findings from Exp. 1 because under high cognitive load the framing bias did not occur in the L2 nor in the L1. In other words, L1 decisions looked as unbiased as L2 decisions if the task was hard enough. We discuss implications for processing and emotionality based accounts that explain behavioral differences of bilinguals dependent on language choice.</p> <p>Corbin, J., McElroy, T., & Black, C.

<p>In this interpretive study[1] we draw on sociocultural approaches to teaching-and-learning of foreign languages (FL) which emphasise (classroom) interaction as key in the learning process. Within this framework we apply the construct of Classroom Interactional Competence (CIC), defined as ‘teachers' and learners' ability to use interaction as a tool for mediating and assisting learning' (Walsh 2011:130), to the analysis of Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) classrooms. One key feature of CIC is teachers' ability to shape learners' contributions and assist them towards the production of better articulated L2 utterances, thereby helping learners to go beyond themselves.</p> <p>Shaping learners' talk in a content-driven CLIL environment may be particularly problematic due to the dual-focused nature of the learning goals inherent to this pedagogical approach. Recent studies have shown that content-teachers systematically deploy an array of multimodal resources and Socratic questioning to ensure students' comprehension of target concepts. Likewise, they tend to respond to students' contributions with evaluative and occasional corrective feedback mainly focused on the use of subject-specific terminology and pronunciation. However, they rarely aim at eliciting progressively more linguistically elaborated contributions (Dalton Puffer, 2007; Escobar & Evnitskaya, 2014; Escobar Urmeneta & Walsh, forthcoming; Llinares & Lyster, 2014).</p> <p>This study aims at further exploring how ‘shaping' learners' talk occurs in CLIL classrooms by examining a lesson in which a content (music) teacher and an FL (English) teacher work in tandem to teach a class of twenty-eight students (age 14) who learn music in English as an L3. To this end, multimodal conversation analysis (e.g. Mondada, 2007) was used to identify the on-line decisions taken by both teachers in order to coordinate their actions aimed at accomplishing the two-fold pedagogical goal: developing the students' understanding of music-related concepts, and their linguistic and communicative resources in the L3. The naturally occurring conversational data come from a bilingual Catalan-Spanish secondary school in Metropolitan Barcelona which participates in a university-school partnership and runs an English-medium CLIL programme, in which one period per week of tandem-teaching has been established in most CLIL subjects.</p> <p>The analysis reveals that the content-teacher mainly devotes his turns-at-talk to elicit content-relevant contributions through which the students display and develop their understanding of the concepts under discussion. More specifically, conversational tokens evidence that the content-teacher is entirely satisfied once the learners have provided minimal one-word contributions, usually confined to the target terminology. The study also describes the ‘complementary' role that the FL specialist plays in the lesson: she manages to position language complexity in the agenda and in doing so affords the learners opportunities to generate more sophisticated wordings in the target language.</p> <p>These outcomes suggest that tandem-teaching may play a relevant role in CLIL programmes in compulsory education, if both learners' communicative and interactional competences are to be achieved. The study also has pedagogical implications for CLIL teacher-education, as tandem-teaching is far from being a preferred practice, at least, in Spanish schools.</p> <p> </p> <p>Notes: [1].

<p>In paradigms focusing on isolated words, spoken-word recognition involves the simultaneous activation of potential word candidates which compete with each other for final correct recognition (McQueen et al., 1994). In continuous speech, speech reductions existing at word boundaries may complicate the word recognition process – but, of course, contextual information (both linguistic and pragmatic) may help resolve competition of this type. Lexical processing is more difficult in L2 than in L1 because L2 listeners often lack phonetic, lexical, syntactic and prosodic knowledge in the target language. In this study, we investigate the on-line lexical segmentation processes that French and Tunisian listeners to L2 English engage in as discourse is progressively revealed. Our goal is to shed further light on L2 spoken-word recognition in context and to understand L2 listening difficulties through a comparison of the working hypotheses formulated by skilled and unskilled listeners during an on-line task. We used a variant of the gating paradigm (Grosjean, 1980) – run in E-prime – in which subjects were instructed to listen to and transcribe an English sentence presented in increments of progressively greater duration. After each gate, they had to indicate how confident they were about their guess using a four-point scale (1 = very sure; 4 = very unsure). In our talk, we will focus on one of the spoken stimuli, the sentence “And this amazing athlete has just broken another world record”, which includes some interesting examples of common reductions and phonetic features in English, such as elision and assimilation. Twenty-one French and Tunisian learners of English completed the task, eleven of whom were identified – through results on a standardized English listening test administered to 226 participants in a larger study – as proficient L2 listeners (the top eleven scores), the other ten as listeners-in-difficulty (the lowest listening scores). Our preliminary results indicate that there is an important difference in the manner in which proficient and less-proficient L2 listeners handle connected speech. Less-proficient listeners delay recognition of words as they wait for lexical and syntactic evidence to appear in the gates. In addition to quantitative evidence of differences between the two proficiency groups, we will examine individual performance data, and strategies possibly deriving from the learners' first language or culture.</p> <p><strong>References:</strong></p> <p>Grosjean, F., 1980.

<p>Teachers and researchers agree that learners have no difficulties in acquiring L2 vowels which are <strong>identical</strong> to those of L1, and therefore there is no need to teach them. Phonetic models, such as Flege's Speech Learning Model (SLM), establish an essential distinction between <strong>similar</strong> and <strong>identical</strong> sounds, unexploited by Lado's contrastive analysis: it is almost impossible for a late learner to acquire, in a native manner, <strong>similar</strong> sounds transcribed with the same API symbol, but of a different phonetic nature.</p> <p>As this distinction has an implication for L2 teaching, our concern is how to decide whether or not two sounds which are transcribed with the same API symbol in L1 and L2 are <strong>identical</strong> or only <strong>similar</strong>? For doing so, the acoustic distance and perceptive similarity were calculated between French and Czech vowels.</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Acoustic distance</span></strong>: The corpus includes 10 French oral vowels [i, e, ɛ, a, u, o, ɔ, y, ø, œ] and 10 Czech monophthong vowels [i:, ɪ, ɛ :, ɛ, a :, a, u :, u, o:, o] that appear :</p> <p>1. Between two short pauses (“in isolation”) inserted in carrier sentences.</p> <p>2. In logatoms CVCVCVC where C = /p, t, k/ inserted in carrier sentences.</p> <p>The Czech corpus was read 4 times by 20 native Czechs from Bohemia (average age 27) and the French corpus was produced 4 times by 10 native non-southern French (average age 28.5).</p> <p>Results: Comparing the mean formant values of French and Czech vowels produced in the same context showed that the vowels systematically differ in at least one of the compared formants (t-test, p < 0.05). Thus, there are no acoustically <strong>identical</strong> vowels between French and Czech.</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Perceptual similarity</span></strong>: Perceptual similarity was studied through an interlingual assimilation test where 10 Czech monolingual listeners identified 10 French oral vowels in terms of 10 Czech monophtong vowels and they assigned a quality score to each percept (between 0 and 5; 5 = best score). The French vowels, used as stimuli, were recorded by 3 native French in isolation (12 repetitions) and by one native French in syllables pVp, tVt and kVk (4 repetitions per context).</p> <p>Results: The result expressed by the value of fit index (= proportion of identification multiplied by the score) shows a strong perceptual similarity of French vowels [i], [ɛ], [a], [u], [o] with Czech timbers [i:], [ɛ/ɛ:], [a/a:], [u/u:], [u/u:], respectively. This similarity, however, varies greatly depending on the context, and the fit index never exceeds 4.6 out of 5. Thus, this result doesn't confirm a perceptual <strong>identity</strong> between any French and Czech vowel.</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion:</span></strong> The combined result shows that strictly <strong>identical</strong> vowels between French and Czech do not exist. In fact, the same vowels in L1 and L2 transcribed with the same phonetic symbol can be “highly similar” in isolation, but less similar or even dissimilar in a particular consonantal context and vice versa. These results point to the importance of inclusion, into the phonetic curriculum of second language teaching, of coarticulation patterns of all L2 vowels.</p>

<p><span>In SLA research, fluency is viewed as one measurable aspect of L2 proficiency that includes smoothness and effortlessness of speech (see Lennon 1990). The majority of L2 fluency studies analyze fluency-related features (e.g. pausing and repair) from speech samples quantitatively, whereas qualitative approaches are rare. To address this gap in research, I included a complementary qualitative analysis in the first substudy of my doctoral research. The analysis of contexts and functions of filled pauses and repetitions showed that certain high-fluency subjects used these so-called disfluency markers for avoiding long pauses and maintaining the flow of talk, that is, for enhancing fluency. A purely frequency-based analysis of these features is therefore not likely to reveal their full role in fluent speech.</span></p> <p><span>The aim of my doctoral dissertation is to create a new framework for comprehensive L2 fluency analysis, highlighting the importance of examining resources that can be used for keeping up fluency.<strong> </strong>Filled pauses and repetitions are viewed as potential stalling mechanisms that are used for coping with processing time pressure (following Dörnyei & Kormos 1998). In addition, I examine the link between communication strategies (CSs) and fluency, combining two separate research fields. I argue that CSs can also be viewed as potential resources for keeping the flow of talk going, since they aid in overcoming troubles mainly related to lexis. The dissertation offers significant methodological implications for L2 fluency research, but also for other fields, including L2 assessment and L2 teaching.</span></p> <p><span>A novel research design was created for exploring the framework empirically. Two groups of students participated in the second substudy of the doctoral dissertation: 9th grade students (15–16-year-olds, N=20) and upper secondary school students (17–18-year-olds, N=18). The purpose of the study is to examine both individual and group level differences in the use of fluency resources. The majority of fluency studies examine monologue data, while little is known about how fluency is maintained in interaction. Therefore, the main task in the study was a pair task, where the subjects had to rank items in the order of usefulness for survival on a desert island. A stimulated recall interview was conducted one day after the pair task to increase the reliability of CS analysis. Furthermore, the subjects performed two monologue tasks: in L1 Finnish to get information about their individual fluency profile and in L2 English to get a long enough speech sample from each subject for fluency analysis. They also completed a vocabulary test (LexTALE) that provided information about their general proficiency level.</span></p> <p><span>Discussion on the following questions would be particularly helpful: 1) What would be the best methods, including statistical methods, for analyzing the materials? 2) Do the materials seem sufficient for exploring the proposed framework?</span></p> <p><span>References</span></p> <p><span>Dörnyei Z. & Kormos J. 1998.

<p>Most studies which support the effectiveness of oral corrective feedback (CF) have investigated the impact of CF on one specific grammar item, such as articles or question forms. Few studies have compared the impact of CF on a range of linguistic targets. However, there is some evidence that different types of CF may affect rule-based and item-based structures in different ways. For example, while Yang and Lyster (2010) found that recasts were equally effective for the acquisition of the rule-based regular past tense as for that of the item-based irregular past tense, they discovered that prompts or output-pushing feedback had larger effects on the rule-based regular past. Since prompts comprise a range of explicit and less explicit techniques, it can be hypothesized that separate prompts will also affect rule-based and item-based structures differentially. To investigate this, the present study compares the effects of two kinds of prompts, the more explicit metalinguistic feedback (MF) and the more implicit elicitation, on the acquisition of the English regular and irregular past tense. A quasi-experimental classroom study involving 31 intermediate learners of English was carried out over a period of two consecutive weeks. The study consisted of an oral and written pre-test (a storytelling test and a grammaticality judgment test), two treatment sessions of one hour each in which the students carried out two communicative storytelling tasks and a post-test. During the treatment, one group received oral CF in the form of elicitation (“One day the man....?”) every time an error was made against the regular or irregular past tense, while the other group was prompted to repair their past tense errors by means of MF (“You need past tense”). When the students' performance during the treatment was analysed, it was found that elicitation had a similar effect on the students' ability to repair regular and irregular past tense errors. However, the students in the MF-group were more successful at repairing regular past tense errors than irregular forms. The comparison of the pre- and post-test scores showed that both types of CF positively affected the students' acquisition of past tense forms in general, but statistical analysis also revealed a difference between the rule-based and item-based structure. A series of unpaired t-tests was carried out on the gain scores for the regular and irregular verbs in both groups. For the regular verbs, no significant difference between the impact of elicitation and MF was found, while in the case of the irregular verbs MF was found to outperform elicitation and this difference was statistically significant. </p> <p>Yang, Y. & R.

<p>Within the generative framework, studies that have examined cross linguistic transfer in second language (L2) acquisition have shown that first language (L1) has a significant influence at the initial stage of L2 acquisition (e.g., White 1989, 1990; 1991; Flynn & Martohardjono, 1994; Schwartz and Sprouse, 1996). However, little is known about L1 transfer at the final stage of L2 acquisition.</p> <p>Inspired by the findings of the previous studies (e.g., White & Juffs, 1998; Juffs & Harrington, 1995), this study examines whether different instantiation of the Empty Category Principle (ECP) in the L1 and the L2 results in negative transfer during the real-time processing of ungrammatical wh-questions with that-trace violations in L2 English. In English subjects are not allowed to be extracted across overt complementizer as in “*Who do the police believe that attacked the man last night?”, because this violates the Empty Category Principle (ECP), which states that traces must be properly governed (Chomsky & Lasnik, 1977). However, in Spanish, subjects can be extracted in the presence of the complementizer. We tested a group of end state L1 Spanish and Turkish learners of L2 English and a group of native English controls on a grammaticality judgment task (GJT) involving long-distance grammatical and ungrammatical wh-questions using a self-paced word-by-word in the moving window procedure. </p> <p>Overall accuracy results indicate that L2 groups, particularly, the Spanish group were significantly less accurate (F (2, 82) =30.22; p<.01) and slower (F (2, 76) =14.80; p<.01) than the native speakers in correctly judging ungrammatical types. For L2 groups, the most difficult type to correctly judge was the wh-extractions with that-trace violation (Spanish M: 2.95; and Turkish M: 4.32 out of 10). Results from self-paced word-by-word reading times (RTs) reveal that the locus of the difficulty in sentences with that-trace where the L2 speakers, particularly Spanish speakers spent significantly longer RTs, was the embedded verb (e.g., ‘attached) that follow the complementizer (F (1, 71) =24.97; p<.01), (see Figure 1 below). These findings show that the Spanish group failed to correctly reject wh-extractions with that-trace violations under the influence of their L1 Spanish in which the sentences are grammatically correct and provide evidence for negative transfer at the end state of an L2. As for Turkish group, since that-trace effect is not present in L1 Turkish, failure in the judgment of wh-questions with that-trace violation can be attributed to pro-drop property of Turkish where sentences with overt subject are grammatically correct.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p>

<p>In L2 sentence processing, L2 readers often fail to use inflectional morphology, such as case, gender or number and person agreement, in building an incremental representation of the input (e.g. Jiang, 2007). One set of approaches argues this reflects fossilization in adult L2 acquisition in that L2 speakers do not integrate (Jiang, 2007), proceduralize (Ullman, 2005) or fully recruit (Clahsen & Felser, 2006; Silva & Clahsen, 2010) morphosyntactic information in sentence comprehension. </p> <p>On the other hand, computational approaches stipulate that, even when the use of inflection is not native-like, grammatical information is accessed and computed during L2 processing because it constrains the types of inflectional errors (e.g. Prévost & White, 2000; McCarthy, 2008). Most of the evidence comes from studies on grammatical gender agreement (e.g. White, Valenzuela, Kozlowska-Macgregor & Leung, 2004) and subject-verb agreement (e.g. McCarthy, 2012). In this paper, we test between these approaches and investigate whether constraints on inflectional variability extend to the on-line integration of different types of case marking in Spanish.</p> <p>This paper reports an off-line acceptability judgment and an on-line eye-tracking study on case in Spanish, involving the polyfunctional case marker ‘a' (Torrego, 1998). Twenty-four native and twenty-four L1 German non-native speakers of Spanish were tested on their sensitivity to case marking violations involving structural case with objects of ditransitive verbs (1) and to violations of inherent case for objects of transitive verbs (differential object marking; DOM (2)). In Spanish, DOM is required for animate objects of transitive verbs (2a&b), while inanimates are unmarked (2c&d; Zagona, 2002).</p> <p>(1) a.

In reading, native speakers showed processing slowdowns for all sentences, too. In contrast, the non-natives evinced slowdowns only for violations of structural case marking with ditransitive verbs (1b) and for the erroneous realization of DOM with inanimate objects (2c).They did not show processing slowdowns for the omission of DOM with animate objects (2b). This processing pattern cross-cuts the distinction between inherent and structural case marking and suggests that the L2 parser is sensitive to grammatical feature hierarchies (e.g. Harley & Ritter, 2002). The parser licenses default markings (animate unmarked) where DOM is required, yet flags feature clashes occasioned by the suppliance of DOM where it is not licensed by a [+animate] feature (inanimate marked). We discuss the findings in the context of approaches to L2 acquisition and processing.</p>

<p>This study aims to analyze the acquisition of formulaic sequences (FSs) in English as a second language (L2) in three different contexts that provide intensive exposure to the target language. Previous research on FSs has suggested that they are an important aspect affecting learners' proficiency (Stengers, Boers, Housen, & Eyckmans, 2011). Several studies have shown that FSs can be effectively learned in instructional settings, especially if there is some kind of intervention that makes learners notice these forms (Boers & Lindstromberg, 2012; Webb, Newton & Chang, 2013). However, there is not much research examining how learners in different settings develop their knowledge of FSs. The objective of this study is to fill this gap by examining three contexts: intensive classroom instruction in the participants' home country (Spain), a stay in an English-learning summer camp (also in Spain), and a stay abroad in the UK. Although the learners in all three contexts received classroom instruction for a minimum of 3 hours/day, the opportunities to use English outside the class were quite different, which is what makes each context unique.</p> <p>The participants of this study (n=209) are a group of young learners (mean age=13.21) who enrolled in one of these three programs for 3-4 weeks in the summer. Their knowledge of FS in English was tested at the beginning and at the end of their respective program through two tasks, one that examined receptive knowledge and the other that tapped productive knowledge of FSs. In the first task, the learners had to judge the acceptability of 20 formulaic expressions in English. The second task was a written dialogue completion task, in which the participants had to fill in some bubbles of a comic strip. The analyses performed suggest that the stay abroad context offers a better environment for the acquisition of formulas in English than the other two. This finding provides evidence for the importance of naturalistic, out-of-class L2 exposure for the learning of FSs.</p> <p> </p> <p>References</p> <p> </p> <p>Boers, F., & Lindstromberg, S. (2012).

<p>Syntactic prominence, i.e. the perceived importance of a sentence's constituents (Birch & Rayner, 2010; Mckoon, Ratcliff, Ward, & Sproat, 1993), has been shown to aid processing and memorization of prominent concepts (Mckoon et al., 1993), decrease shallow processing (Sanford & Sturt, 2002) and the likelihood of overlooking factual errors (Baker & Wagner, 1987) in L1. The present study represents the first attempt to explore and compare the role of syntactic prominence in L1 and L2 incidental vocabulary acquisition (IVA).<br />Twenty low frequent German nouns (e.g. “Zunder”, i.e. tinder) were substituted by pseudowords to create novel words which were embedded in short texts pairs. The text pairs differed only in the structure of two sentences which contained the novel word either in high syntactic prominence condition (HSPC; i.e. as subjects of main clauses) or low syntactic prominence condition (LSPC; objects in subordinate clauses). Eighty L1 and 80 advanced L2 participants read 20 texts, half in each condition. After each text, several additional sentences were read in a self-paced manner, one containing the novel word preceded by either a semantically plausible (e.g. “feucht” – wet) or implausible adjective (e.g. “reich” – rich). <br />The results showed that both L1 and L2 participants successfully inferred the meaning of the novel words in both syntactic conditions as indicated by slower reading times in the implausible condition. However, while the implausibility effect appeared already at the novel word itself in both conditions in L1, in L2 it appeared at the novel word only in HSPC. In LSPC, the implausibility effect started to appear only on the subsequent spillover region. The earlier implausibility effect in HSPC indicates that the meaning of the novel words was more readily available and probably stronger represented. <br />We assume that the acquisition advantage for words with high syntactic prominence in L2 can be attributed to a higher allocation of reader's attention to prominent sentence constituents, thus following Givon's (1992) claims that syntax serves as “mental processing instructions” that direct attention. L1 participants did not display this benefit because of their high linguistic competence which allowed sufficient processing of both subject and object, main and subordinate clause. The results will be discussed with respect to IVA, shallow processing and noticing (Schmidt, 2012).<br /><br />References:<br /><br />Baker, L., & Wagner, J.L. (1987).

<p><strong>Background</strong></p> <p>In parts of northern Europe and Scandinavia English is near ubiquitous in everyday environments. It is a preferred medium of communication in many social practices and, from early ages, young people have widespread encounters with English in leisure-time domains. In such contexts research indicates that school students' motivation to learn L2 English and L3s (e.g. French/German/Spanish) can be negatively impacted (see e.g. Henry, 2015; Ushioda, 2013). However, motivation researchers have yet to offer conceptually coherent explanations. One plausible reason for declining L2/L3 motivation may lie in the processes that generate motivated learning behaviour. Drawing on theories of self-discrepancy, Dörnyei (2005) proposes that L2 motivation is generated by the learner's sense of unease about the gap between current and future-oriented language-speaking self-images. In situations where the learner has either (i) a strong current self-image, or (ii) a weak ideal self-image, this gap can appear small. Little unease will be generated and motivational energy will consequently be low. In a context such as Sweden the first of these two scenarios may be particularly true for school-aged learners of L2 English. The second may similarly be true for learners of L3 French/German/Spanish. </p> <p><strong>Purpose, Methodology and Results</strong></p> <p>To investigate these proposals this study adopts a novel methodology. Unlike previous research where only ideal selves are measured, here, in a questionnaire administered to a sample of students (n=116) taking CEFR B1.2 English and CEFR A2.2 French/German/Spanish, both current and future selves were measured. While for English mean scores for current and ideal selves were both high (m=4.12; m=4.27), for French/German/Spanish scores were both low (m=2.71; m=2.86) (all measured on 5-point Likert scales). In both cases the discrepancy between current and ideal selves was small (Cohen's d < 0.20). Further, for English, the impact of the ideal L2 self on a criterion measure of intended effort (r=.34) was substantially smaller than for six reference studies involving similarly-aged students from contexts where English is not extensively encountered in social/societal domains (correlation coefficients ranging from .62 to .75).</p> <p><strong>Implications</strong></p> <p>The findings have methodological and pedagogical and implications. In the increasing number of contexts where English is highly present in social/societal domains, account needs to be taken of learners' current L2/L3 selves. This is important not just in empirical investigations; ideal self-supporting/enhancing interventions need also to be calibrated with the nature of the discrepancy. While for English action should be directed to generating visionary content additional to that contained in current L2 selves (e.g. self-images in professional, vocational and higher educational domains), for L3s focus needs to be directed to generating self-in-future images as a multilingual speaker; someone fluent in English and another foreign language. </p> <p><strong>References</strong></p> <p>Dörnyei, Z.

<p>The dative alternation as displayed in (1) has been widely researched for English as a native language (cf. Bresnan et al. 2007).</p> <p> </p> <p>(1) a. The boy gives [the flowers]theme [to his girlfriend]recipient. PP dative</p> <p> b. The boy gives [his girlfriend]recipient [the flowers]theme. NP dative</p> <p>Recent studies of English as an L1 (e.g. Bresnan et al. 2007) show that the native speakers' choices depend on the interplay of multiple linguistic factors, such as syntactic weight, animacy and pronominality of theme and recipient.</p> <p>With respect to the dative alternation in English as a Second Language (ESL) much less research has been done. Even though the effects of the linguistic factors have been addressed in some studies, only one study investigates probabilistic factors in a multifactorial (experimental) study (Jäschke & Plag 2014). There is only one corpus study of the dative alternation in ESL (Callies & Szeczesniak 2008). This study shows amongst other things that Polish and German ESL learners produce both PP and NP datives even though the prevalent construction in their L1s is the NP dative. The question in how far L1 influence plays a role in the production of dative constructions is still under debate.</p> <p>This study tackles this problem. The present corpus study examines more than 2300 dative constructions, taken from the ICLE corpus (Granger et al. 2002), produced by advanced ESL learners of 14 different L1s. The influence of linguistic factors, alongside the influence of the learners' L1 and their proficiency were investigated using linear mixed effect regression models.</p> <p>The results show that linguistic factors which are known to influence the English (L1) dative alternation are highly predictive in ESL as well. Proficiency (measured in years of ESL instruction and months spent in an English speaking country) failed to reach significance.</p> <p>The most important result with respect to cross-linguistic influence is that learners with different L1 backgrounds differ significantly in their choice of dative construction. Turkish learners for instance have an extreme bias towards the PP dative, whereas Dutch learners prefer the NP dative. These differences between learners with different L1s backgrounds are, however, difficult to interpret in the light of transfer approaches to SLA.</p> <p>In a transfer perspective we expect learners to use dative constructions which correspond to those found in their L1s. This is however not the case. E.g. in Dutch (L1) we find a dative alternation like in English, but Dutch ESL learners have a strong bias towards the NP dative. Turkish (L1) has a rather inflexible word order which corresponds to the NP rather than the PP dative (Haspelmath 2013). Turkish learners, however, have a very strong bias towards the PP dative.</p> <p>The paper will offer possible explanations for these rather unexpected results by providing detailed analyses of the structural intricacies involved with selected L1s (Turkish, Dutch and Japanese), and will discuss the implications of these findings for theories of transfer, processability and the role of typological distance.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>

<p>This contribution discusses to what extent absolute beginner learners can analyse the input they are exposed to in order to retrieve the morphological structure of target lexical items. This is regarded as a necessary step to develop hypotheses as to word-formation strategies in the target language and apply them productively in L2 speech to comply with lexical gaps.</p> <p>The data are part of the Italian database of the VILLA project, a multi-national, cross-linguistic initiative dedicated to the earlies stages of Polish L2 acquisition under controlled input conditions (Dimroth et al. 2013). 31 Italian learners with no experience of the target language took part in a 14-hour Polish course taught by a professional teacher, whose speech represents the only input available. This was recorded and transcribed, so as to correlate its features with the results of the numerous tests learners took during the course.</p> <p>This contribution focusses on a "Question&Answer test", which learners took twice after 4:30 hours (T1) and again after 10:30 hours (T2) of exposure to the input. The test requires learners to answer a question regarding a human referent by stating his or her nationality or profession. <br />Crucially, not all target lexical items had been introduced during the course, which makes it possible to observe the strategies learners employ to fill their lexical gaps.</p> <p>Focussing on the unknown lexical items, the analysis reveals that the suffix -ka, which in the VILLA input typically characterises feminine nouns, is generalised by learners to produce animate nouns of both sexes. The lexical basis is normally modelled on the corresponding word of either the learner's L1 or other known languages (Rast 2010): thus, for instance, a policewoman (pol. policjantka) may be described with the word [vidʒi'lantko] (it. vigilante) or [po'liska] (engl. police).</p> <p>Input analysis proves that in addition to being farily common, the suffix -ka is particularly univocal as regards its form-function association (MacWhinney & Bates 1987, Dressler 2006): words ending in -ka are most often feminine animate nouns, and conversely feminine animate nouns are typically construed with this suffix. Therefore, it is argued that it might be relatively easy for learners to associate this formant with a specific meaning (e.g. human noun), albeit not necessarily in a target-like manner.</p> <p>The findings suggest that learners can analyse the morphological structure of target words even after minimal exposure to the input, identifying at first those formants whose relation to a given, rather generic function seems particularly evident. The paper then proceeds to compare the test results obtained at T1 and T2, in order to verify whether further exposure to the input has any effect on the learners' ability to associate derivational morphemes with the corresponding function. Specifically, the question of interest at this stage is whether additional input might help learners to refine form-function associations, i.e. to select increasingly specific and target-like meanings for the form in question. If this is the case, then at T2 the suffix -ka might be reserved for feminine nouns alone, as required by the TL.</p>

<p>The processing and acquisition of morpho-syntax in the early stages of L2 development have received growing interest in recent SLA research, some sensitivity to form having been found from the very beginning of the acquisitional process (Rast 2008). This partly contrasts with the traditional view that initial learners tend to privilege meaning over form (VanPatten 2004) and to rely on lexical rather than grammatical information (Bardovi-Harlig 1992); if present at all, morphological variation is not believed to have any functional value (Klein & Perdue 1997). Within this debate, our work aims at a deeper understanding of the processing of Polish nominal morphology in the earliest stages of acquisition, with a focus on the role of the L1 and of specific input properties.</p> <p>The study is part of the VILLA project (Dimroth et al. 2013), which investigates the initial phases of the acquisition of Polish under fully controlled input conditions. Learners with five different L1s took part in a 14-hour Polish course taught by a native speaker, whose speech was planned, recorded and transcribed. This methodology makes it possible to correlate the development of the learner variety with input properties such as the frequency and context of occurrence of any linguistic element.</p> <p>In order to find out when and where initial learners first establish an opposition between nominative (NOM) and accusative (ACC) NPs, two tasks were administered to groups of adult German (N= 20), Dutch(N=20), French (N=17) and Italian (N=17) L1 speakers. <br />A Comprehension test examines how learners interpret argument roles (AGENT vs. PATIENT) in the presence of case marking. In a repetition test, learners were asked to repeat short transitive sentences in Polish as accurately as possible. In both tests, target sentences vary in constituent order (SO vs. OS). The tasks were taken after identical exposure to the input, so that they are fully comparable. Each was administered twice, namely after 9 hours (T1) and 13:30 hours (T2) of exposure to the input. <br />By correlating the results of the two tests, we can draw an overall picture of the learners' morphosyntactic competence in comprehension and repetition (Saturno, Latos & Watorek 2015).</p> <p>The results highlight several tendencies common to all groups, such as higher scores in comprehension than repetition, a preference for NOM as an invariable word-form, and minimal scores in the repetition of OS targets, most probably due to perceptual factors (Saturno 2015). Accuracy scores for all groups improve from T1 to T2, suggesting a beneficial effect of further, albeit limited exposure to the input. Cross-linguistically, a significant effect of the L1 was found, French learners performing significantly worse than the other groups. It is hypothesised that such differences may be linked to the L1 phonology, and specifically to stress position. Crucially, French differs from all other L1s in having fixed stress; in addition, its pattern (stressed final syllable) is not compatible with that of Polish (stressed penultimate syllable), which may hamper word segmentation and hence the retrieval of morphological information.</p>

<p>Formulaic language has long been considered an important element of language proficiency in general and of fluency in particular (e.g. Pawley & Syder, 1983). A number of studies have also provided empirical evidence suggesting a positive link between formulaic language and spoken fluency (e.g. Wood, 2010). As a subset of formulaic language, collocations, i.e. two-three word combinations such as make a decision, major catastrophe, and afraid of, are also assumed to contribute positively to fluency. However, research seems to indicate that even advanced learners experience problems with producing consistently correct and appropriate collocations (e.g. Nesselhauf, 2005).</p> <p>This situation leads to the following conundrum: if even advanced learners have problems producing native-like collocations, how can this be reconciled with their status as advanced learners, given that fluency is an important component of overall language proficiency? Despite the large body of research into formulaic language and spoken fluency, there seems to be a lack of empirical evidence showing how collocations might influence fluency. This paper is based on a project which addresses this issue by looking at the relationship between lecturers' overall language proficiency, collocational competence and fluency.</p> <p>The project draws on data from 15 mini-lectures recorded for an oral proficiency test in English for lecturers at the University of Copenhagen. The lecturers, who came from three different university departments, were assessed on a 5-point holistic scale based on 5 dimensions, including fluency. Examiners' global and fluency scores from the test were analysed against collocational competence and fluency variables. Collocational competence was operationalised as the number of validated collocations and unacceptable collocational combinations used. Temporal fluency was measured by calculating speech rate, mean length of run and phonation-time ratio for each lecturer. </p> <p>Preliminary findings showed no significant correlations between collocational competence, use of unacceptable collocational combinations, and overall proficiency score or fluency measures. However, further analysis of the texts revealed that possible relationships were hidden by major differences in the types of discourse used across the three different departments. These included variances in the relative proportions of general collocations to domain-specific collocations used by speakers from the different disciplines, as well as the degree of technicality of the domain-specific collocations.</p> <p>This appears to have ramifications not only for what makes up collocational competence across different domains, but also for how examiners' perceptions of fluency vary across academic disciplines, according to the level of content comprehensibility.</p> <p>The paper therefore discusses the need for taking domain-specific collocations into account when measuring and assessing both collocational competence and fluency.</p> <p> </p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">References: </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p> <p><strong>Nesselhauf, N. </strong>2005.

<p align="left">The present study examined the effects of whole and part learning on the acquisition of second language (L2) vocabulary. In whole learning, the materials to be learnt are repeated in one large block, whereas in part learning, the materials are divided into smaller blocks and repeated. Although the majority of research on part and whole learning has been conducted in the field of psychology (e.g., Brown, 1924; Kornell, 2009; McGeoch, 1931; Woodworth & Schlosberg, 1954), the issue of part and whole learning may also be relevant for L2 vocabulary acquisition. For instance, suppose we have 20 words to study. Would it be more effective to learn all 20 words at one time (whole learning) or would it be more effective to divide them into smaller blocks (part learning)?</p> <p align="left">From a theoretical perspective, the retrieval practice effect (Baddeley, 1997; Ellis, 1995) and the list-length effect (Gillund & Shiffrin, 1984; Van Bussel, 1994) suggest that part learning should be more effective than whole learning. Most empirical studies, however, have found the advantage of whole over part learning (e.g., Brown, 1924; Crothers & Suppes, 1967; Kornell, 2009; McGeoch, 1931; Seibert, 1932). Even though the findings of the previous studies help to shed light on this issue, they may be limited in that the part-whole learning distinction and spacing were confounded. More specifically, in previous studies, whole learning always had longer spacing than part learning. This is problematic considering the distributed practice effect, according to which introducing a large amount of spacing increases retention (e.g., Bahrick & Phelps, 1987; Cepeda et al., 2009; Kornell, 2009; Pashler, Zarow, & Triplett, 2003). In other words, the results of the earlier studies may be at least partly attributed to spacing rather than the part-whole distinction per se. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of part and whole learning on L2 vocabulary acquisition in two experiments while isolating the effects of the part-whole distinction and spacing. </p> <p align="left">In two experiments, a total of 224 Japanese university students studied 20 English-Japanese word pairs. Experiment 1 compared the effects of the following three treatments: 20-item whole learning, 4-item part learning, and 10-item part learning. Unlike previous studies, part and whole learning were matched in spacing. Learning was measured by productive and receptive posttests administered immediately and 1 week after the treatment. In Experiment 2, spacing as well as the part-whole learning distinction were manipulated, and the following three treatments were compared: 20-item whole learning, 4-item part learning with short spacing, and 4-item part learning with long spacing.</p> <p>Results of the two experiments suggested that (a) as long as spacing is equivalent, the part-whole distinction has little effect on learning, and (b) spacing has a larger effect on learning than the part-whole distinction. Pedagogically, the findings indicate that introducing a large amount of spacing is more important than the part-whole learning distinction. The present study is also methodologically significant in that it isolated the effects of the part-whole distinction and spacing, which have been confounded in previous research.</p>

<p>Many contemporary L2 study materials include exercises which require learners to match the constituent parts of collocations, for example by supplying the appropriate verb (e.g., meet) to precede a given noun phrase (e.g., the deadline) in gapped sentences. However, a study by Boers, Demecheleer, Coxhead and Webb (2014) found that wrong choices made in this type of exercise can leave undesirable memory traces, despite corrective feedback. This finding suggests that, in the case of collocation learning, at least, it may be advisable to design procedures where wrong exercise responses are avoided. The quasi-experimental study reported in this presentation investigates this possibility.</p> <p>Two groups of high-intermediate EFL learners (n = 19) were given exercises consisting of gapped sentences where the verb of a collocation was missing. In one treatment condition (the error-prone procedure), the students tried to supply the verbs and were subsequently given (corrective) feedback on their responses. The students crossed out any wrong responses and wrote down the correct ones on their work sheets. In another condition (the error-free procedure), the students were given a hand-out with examples of the target collocations to help them complete the blanks in the exercise. Both groups of students were given four exercises each targeting 14 verb-noun collocations, spread over four lessons. They took a pre-test two weeks prior to doing the first exercise and a post-test two weeks after completing the fourth exercise. Like the exercises, the tests consisted of gapped sentences with the verb of the verb-noun collocations missing.</p> <p>Comparisons of pre-test to post-test performance on all the item responses which were wrong in the pre-test (totalling 505) show a significant advantage of the error-free over the error-prone exercise procedure, in particular where wrong exercise responses were given under the latter procedure. Only 16.5% of the incorrect exercise responses in the error-prone condition were followed by correct post-test responses, indicating that the corrective feedback often failed to entrench the correct collocation in the learner's memory. In addition, almost 4% of these students' correct pre-test responses were replaced by wrong ones in the post-test. We argue that the lack of semantic distinctiveness of the verb (e.g., make, do, have), in many collocations as well as competition from semantically related verbs (e.g., say, tell, speak) makes it particularly hard for learners to block unhelpful cross-associations during the deliberate learning of sets of verb-noun collocations.</p> <p>While the exemplar-modelled, error-free procedure yielded generally better outcomes – 38.5% of incorrect pre-test responses were replaced by correct post-test responses – it evidently did not work wonders either. The direct provision of exemplars probably made the task too easy and shallow. We conclude by proposing ways of designing and implementing collocation exercises that can promote more engagement and yet minimize the risk of error.</p> <p>Reference:</p> <p>Boers, F., Demecheleer, M., Coxhead, A, & Webb, S.

<p align="left">This research explores the effects of guided pre-task planning on the development of Japanese university students' oral performance. In task-based language teaching (TBLT), developing speaking proficiency often can be one of major learning goals. In spite of the movement toward a communicative approach of language instruction, there is still misunderstanding that attention to form in TBLT is limited. One way to balance communication and grammar in TBLT is to add form-focus instruction to the tasks. In this study, pre-task planning is implemented to help learners improve their accuracy.</p> <p align="left">Another problem in the field of TBLT is that speaking proficiency has often been measured using the Complexity, Accuracy and Fluency (CAF) framework. However, very few researchers have discussed successful achievement of communicative goals although most researchers have used communicative tasks. Therefore, adequacy can be seen as a separate dimension alongside CAF measurements. Based on the two problems, this current study examines: 1) the extent guided pre-task planning with form-focus will enhance students' longitudinal development on CAF and 2) relationships between CAF and human rating of students' oral performance.</p> <p align="left">The participants are approximately 70 first-year university students attending a private Japanese university in Japan. The 3/2/1 fluency activity is implemented in every class (week 1- week 14). In the 3/2/1 task, students talk about the same topic for 3 minutes, then 2 minutes, and finally 1 minute. When students talk for 2 minutes and 1 minutes, they keep speaking faster so that they can repeat the same talk within shorter time.</p> <p align="left"> The participants are divided into three different groups. In every lesson, each group receives a different treatment prior to the 3/2/1 fluency activity. The first group is the control group. In this group, students do not engage in pre-task planning activity. Instead, the students start the 3/2/1 minute fluency tasks immediately. The second group is the planning group with a form-focus. The students receive a teacher-led planning handout focusing on linguistic formulaic form. The third group is that focusing on meaning groups. This group pays attention to the content of what they talk about rather than the form and organization. The participants brainstorm on a piece of blank paper about what they are going to say for four minutes by themselves. On the blank paper, they write English words or phrases so that it can look like a mind-mapping.</p> <p align="left">Data will be analyzed based on students' oral performance on three tests. Students will complete a monologic speaking test three times as Test 1 (Week 2), Test 2 (Week 8), and Test 3 (Week 14). One-way, repeated-measures MANOVA are used to analyze changes in fluency, accuracy and complexity. The independent variable is group (Three levels: Control group, Form-focus, Meaning-focus). The dependent variables are Complexity, Accuracy, and Fluency. In order to answer a research question about the relationship between CAF and human ratings, trained native speakers will rate students' oral performance. A FACET analysis is conducted. </p>

<p>One of the precursors of native-like selection and fluency is the proper use of formulaic chunks, which are presumably stored and retrieved as wholes (e.g., Wray & Perkins 2000). Previous research has shown that formulaic expressions reduce processing effort, suggesting that (i) they are faster to read than non-formulaic ones, and (ii) native speakers typically outperform non-native speakers due to familiarity with such sequences (e.g., Siyanonva-Chanturia et al. 2011). While these studies focused on processing dimensions by employing the eye-tracking methodology, the articulatory characteristics of formulaic sequences in L1 vs. L2 speech have remained largely underexplored.</p> <p>Here we investigate the temporal dynamics of formulaic sequences in production, which have been suggested to differ from non-formulaic sequences with respect to the rate of articulation, pause characteristics, and intonation (Weinert 1995). We hypothesize that (i) native speakers (NS) are faster in the production of formulaic sequences than non-natives, and (ii) formulaic sequences are produced faster than their non-formulaic counterparts due to access to the “phrasicon”, where such sequences are linked to a routinized muscular movement. However, non-native speakers (NNS) are expected to show no difference between the two types of sequences in production since they fail to process them holistically. We additionally investigated whether NNS exhibit phonological reduction in a native-like way in the realization of formulaic sequences. Twelve highly proficient German speakers of English and 8 English native speaker controls participated in a read-aloud task. Using 4 formulaic categories (Idioms, Proverbs, Conversational-Routines and Binomials), we embedded most frequently used formulaic sequences in 24 utterances and created the non-formulaic counterparts by replacing the formulaic sequences with the non-formulaic ones (e.g., Binomials: We just have to <strong>wait and see</strong> vs. We just have to <strong>wait and pray</strong>).</p> <p>Our results showed that NS were generally faster in producing the formulaic sequences compared to NNS. No group difference however emerged in the production of non-formulaic sequences. Furthermore, NS produced formulaic sequences significantly faster than their non-formulaic counterparts in 3 of the 4 conditions, with no difference in Proverbs. Strikingly, formulaic sequences were not produced at a significantly faster speech rate by NNS in any of the conditions but the Binomials. A qualitative analysis of Binomial productions revealed that both the NS and NNS applied phonological reduction to the Binomials (but not to their non-formulaic counterparts) although this was more salient in the NS group. This suggests that the proper application of phonological reduction may reveal native-like patterns in the production of L2 formulaic sequences.</p> <p>Our production results are on a par with the previous findings that suggested a processing advantage for formulaic sequences only in NS. We suggest that native-like articulation of most idiomatic chunks may be very difficult to attain by post-pubescent learners. Furthermore, prosodic reduction might be a precursor to the acquisition of formulaic language since this arguably accounted for the native-like behavior in NNS, albeit only with Binomials, which not only were highly familiar to our NNS, but also are easy to acquire in SLA (cf. Howarth 1998).</p>

<p>It is a widespread idea that one of the best ways for improving one's second language (L2) skills is going abroad (Howard, 2001; Regan et al., 2009; Kinginger, 2013). Such an example are au pair girls: as L2 speakers, they are confronted with a hybrid context (König, 2014; Pochon-Berger et al., in press), in which both formal (the workplace) and informal (the domestic context) features are present. Working as an au pair is an established practice, however little is known about what characterises the daily au pair's routine, especially the moments of interactions with the host-parents, and how this influences her L2 interactional competence. This presentation is based on a qualitative case study from a corpus of three hours of audio-recorded interactions between a German-speaking au pair girl learning French in Switzerland and her host-family. Drawing on Conversation Analysis, I focus on a specific practice that is regularly found in my conversational corpus: when, in the course of an interrupted storytelling activity, the au pair girl links back her discourse to a previous conversational topic. The analysis shows excerpts from different points in time in order to document changes over time in the ways the au pair accomplishes a topical backlinking.</p> <p>The state of research so far has shown the features of backlinking in L1 conversations (Schegloff, 1996; Local, 2004; De Stefani & Horlacher, 2008), however L2 conversations still remain underexplored (but see König, 2014). Through a qualitative case study, the present contribution highlights the characteristics of backlinking in French L2 talk-in-interaction (linguistic, structural and organizational features). Subsequently, it will enlarge its scope by reflecting on how microanalyses are usable for the domain of language sciences and what these sciences can do with the results of qualitative micro-analytical works. I argue that language sciences can include more bottom up research processes and outputs in university courses (f. ex. for future language teachers). Moreover, they should improve their relationship to the professional world with all the stakeholders (such as, in my case, au pairs, host-families and agencies). In fact, analysts can use their research for spreading information about, for instance, the development of interactional competence in an L2 starting from a circumscribed, well defined action. Herewith, I position my analysis within a larger ongoing discussion about the applicability of fine-grained analysis outputs (cf. Antaki, 2011; Alatriste, in press) and argue that research findings concerning conversational data are suitable for several practical considerations for the work of different professional categories.</p>

<p>Evidence shows that inflectional morphology is difficult to acquire, particularly in the first stages of the SLA process (Clahsen & Felser, 2006; Marsden et al., 2013) but there is far less agreement on what this difficulty entails (DeKeyser, 2005; Ellis, 2006). In particular, it is still unclear how complexity differentials of L2 inflectional morphology interact with the learning conditions and the learner's cognitive mechanisms in determining learning difficulty in SLA. The research reported on in this talk aims to address the interplay between these constructs, in the belief that a fuller understanding of what makes L2 inflectional morphology more or less difficult requires a cognitive perspective on the matter.</p> <p>L2 difficulty is defined in cognitive terms as the mental resources L2 learners have to allocate and the cognitive mechanisms they have to employ in processing L2 features (Bulté & Housen, 2012). Accordingly, online measures of language processing are used, namely learners' gaze duration and pupil dilation, to empirically gauge L2 difficulty, whereby gaze duration is believed to tap into the quantity of processing and pupil dilation into the depth of processing of the target feature (cf. Just & Carpenter, 1993; Papesh & Goldinger, 2010; Schotter & Rayner, 2012). Furthermore, the complexity of the input is operationalised in terms of the salience of the inflectional morpheme. Salience itself is seen as a function of perceptual (visual distinctiveness), structural (allomorphy and homophony) and experiential (frequency, L1/L2 contrast) factors (cf. DeKeyser, 2005; Ellis, 2006; Goldschneider & DeKeyser, 2001; VanPatten, 2007).</p> <p>On the basis of this salience construct, artificial inflectional suffixes of varying degrees and types of salience were designed and combined with familiar existing English stems (e.g., hotelolp 'his hotel') in a reading task presented to 50 L2 learners (adult L1 speakers of Dutch) under three different learning conditions: an incidental, implicit form-focused and explicit form-focused condition. During the reading task, the learners' gaze durations and pupil dilations were recorded by an eye tracker to evaluate the difficulty of processing the target morphemes. After the reading task, the learners took four posttests that evaluated the amount of learning (implicit and explicit, and declarative and productive knowledge) of the target morphemes. The influence of cognitive learner variables on L2 difficulty was assessed via the Modern Language Aptitude Test (Carroll & Sapon, 2002) and the Reading Span Task (Daneman & Carpenter, 1980).</p> <p>Preliminary results showed that the beginning L2 learners were sensitive to both form and meaning of the target suffixes after brief exposure but that this sensitivity was strongly mediated by the type and degree of salience of the L2 morpheme, by the instructional conditions and by the cognitive abilities of the L2 learner, both in and by themselves and in interaction with each other. The findings thus reveal an intricate interplay between the linguistic input, the learning context and the learner's cognitive abilities in determining learning difficulty in a second language.</p>

<p>Personality plays a major role in influencing human behaviour (Eysenck, 1994). Intelligence has similarly been shown to influence everyday competence (e.g., accomplishing tasks like banking (Gottfredson, 1997)), academic and job performance (e.g., Schmidt & Hunter, 1998), and various important social characteristics (e.g., socioeconomic status; Jensen, 1998). It is thus surprising that research investigating the effect of intelligence and personality on second language (L2) acquisition is limited, particularly compared to work on other individual differences (e.g., motivation). The present study fills this gap by examining the role of intelligence and the Big Five personality traits (extraversion, conscientiousness, agreeableness, openness to experience, and neuroticism; e.g., McCrae & Costa, 2003) in English-speaking learners' L2 acquisition of French fluency. A high degree of inter-learner variability has been observed in the mastery of L2 fluency (e.g., Dewaele, 2002). This is due to the complexity of this phenomenon, which is conditioned by several variables, many of which correlate with both intelligence (e.g., working memory capacity) and personality traits (e.g., amount of input received and output produced; short-term memory capacity and language anxiety). A study of the effects of these two variables is thus warranted.</p> <p> My doctoral research addresses five lacunae in previous fluency research. First, although intelligence has received much attention in psychology and correlates with various basic cognitive tasks (e.g., Deary, 2000), L2 fluency studies have largely ignored its potential influence. Second, personality research has looked almost exclusively extraversion's effect on L2 fluency (e.g., Dewaele & Furnham, 2000), neglecting the other four personality variables. Third, some researchers suggest that the knowledge required for L1 and L2 fluency differs (e.g., Towell & Dewaele, 2005), while others propose that learners who are more fluent in their L1 are also more fluent in their L2 (Raupach, 1980). It is therefore crucial that fluency be studied in both languages to control for the possibility that fluency is a stable construct. Fourth, in previous studies, measures of fluency have sometimes been limited. For example, Dewaele & Furnham (2000) only included ‘er' among their learners' hesitations, ignoring pauses, fillers, and other hesitation markers. Finally, previous L2 fluency studies have not always effectively controlled for or operationalized important learner variables (e.g., known languages, proficiency). For example, Ghapanchi, Khajavy & Asadpour (2011) used learners' self-evaluations as the measure of target language proficiency.</p> <p> In this presentation, I discuss a study designed to address these weaknesses that examines the influence of intelligence, personality, and L1 fluency on the L2 spoken fluency of 100 low-advanced learners using 6 temporal/hesitation measures (i. speech rate; speech runs that are ii. hesitation-free, iii. filler-free, iv. fluent, v. repetition-free, and vi. grammatical-repair-free; Freed, Segalowitz & Dewey, 2004). Two elicited production tasks (picture-narration, and sentence inversion), which differ in syntactic and lexical complexity, serve to obtain speech samples. Proficiency is measured via standardized proficiency tests, personality traits using the Big Five Aspect Scale Test (DeYoung, Quilty & Peterson, 2007). Finally, a short form of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (Wechsler, 1981) measures IQ. Data is analyzed via multiple regressions.</p>

<p>Listening to young children's talk focused on language helps us to see the inner mechanisms of their thinking about language as they engaged in the process of language learning.<strong> </strong>According to Blum-Kulka et al (2004), meta-linguistic talk presents a high level of linguistic awareness, which includes an analysis of "the skill component responsible for the structuring and explication of linguistic knowledge" (p. 317). Up to now few studies focused on meta-linguistic talk among preschool L2 learners. These studies suggested a possible link between this type of peer talk and L2 acquisition (e.g., Cekaite & Aronsson, 2005). The aim of this longitudinal study was to examine and analyze a children meta-linguistic talk and its main characteristics in classroom discourses in bilingual Arabic-Hebrew speaking preschool. This talk takes form of short comments or fully-fledged discursive events.</p> <p>The target Arabic-Hebrew speaking preschool<strong> </strong>is placed in the central area of Israel and includes 29 children (19 Arabic (L1) speaking children and 10 Hebrew (L1) speaking children). The preschool applies flexible language practices as a main principle of its bilingual pedagogy.<strong> </strong>Arabic and Hebrew are the two main spoken languages in Israel. Although Arabic is spoken by an Israeli minority population, it is considered an official language alongside to Hebrew. Most Arab-Israelis understand and speak Hebrew, and use it at work and in other settings, while the Arabic language is scarcely presented in the landscape of cities with a Jewish population and the level of competence of the Jewish children in Arabic is relatively low. In light of this complex socio-linguistic context, the bilingual Arabic-Hebrew education was established in early 1990ies.<strong> </strong>The data were collected during one year and included: setting-focused video recordings of a) groups of preschool's children talk during engagement in joint play in various areas of the classroom; b) child/children-teacher talk during classroom activities and spontaneous interactions; c) semi-structured interviewers with children. the following content categories were extracted from the children' meta-linguistic talk: (1) focus on language form; (2) discourse management: a. children as language policy makers<strong>: </strong>who speaks what language to whom and when; b. critical evaluation of L2 competence; c. relation to bilingualism as giving a particular superiority; (3) difficulty in understanding talk (talk about lack of understanding and asking for translation).</p> <p> We found that through active discourse management within inter-group contexts, children tried to build their social worlds and enhance their ethnic identities.<strong> </strong>This type of the meta-linguistic talk addressed such macro-level issues as minority-majority language status and asymmetry in L2 input. The relatively central place of the discourse management in peer meta-linguistic talk is conditioned by type of the target educational setting as a two-way bilingual preschool and by its specific socio-cultural context.</p> <p>Blum-Kulka, S., Huck-Taglicht, D., & Avni, H.

<p>Most SLA theories and models have recognised cross-linguistic influence (CLI) as an important or even the major factor determining second language acquisition, which in interaction with other factors together determine the likelihood of the transferability of a given structure in a given context. Interlingual identifications made by learners between the first (L1) or formerly learned (Ln) and target language (TL) enable both positive and negative transfer from the L1/Ln, depending on the learners' perceptions of the convergence or divergence of the L1/Ln and TL patterns. However, largely due to visibility of non-target like language usage the majority of studies on CLI have been focused on negative outcomes of the issue or dealt with CLI without separate tackling of the positive and the negative influence.</p> <p>While the importance of CLI has long been acknowledged in the areas of phonology and lexis, morphosyntactic transfer has been treated with a great deal of skepticism throughout the history of CLI research. Morphology, in particular, is an area where some previous research has maintained that CLI is rare or even non-existent (for references, see e.g Jarvis and Odlin 2000). Underplaying morphological CLI, especially positive one, must be seen against the fact that most empirical SLA research on CLI has focused on languages with a scant morphological repertory. In closely related languages like Finnish and Estonian with their rich inflectional morphology, the L1 influence is clearly seen in bound morphology and its outcomes are considerably more often positive than negative (Author 1 2005; Author 1 and Martin 2007).</p> <p>The paper aims to explore how and why learners' perceptions of similarity do or do not get realised as positive CLI in inflectional morphology on the basis of the following two databases:</p> <p>1) thinking aloud protocols and retrospective interviews on an experimental inflection test of Estonian university students learning Finnish as a foreign language;</p> <p>2) longitudinal video-taped data of Estonian primary school children learning Finnish as a second language in a preparatory class (The Long Second: LONGitudinal classroom data about children's development in Finnish as a SECOND language)<strong></strong></p> <p>Examples gathered from both databases will be discussed by applying a comparison-based approach to CLI research (Jarvis 2010) to identify the positive outcomes of CLI and to shed light on the processes of benefiting from or rejecting converging morphological patterns of L1 and TL by the learners in TL processing.</p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>References</strong></p> <p>Author 1 2005.

<p>The impact of learning context has been the focus of much research lately, especially the effects of the study abroad (SA) context, probably because of the need to speak a second language (L2) imposed by globalization. Research on the effects of the SA context has mostly compared the gains that SA participants experience in certain L2 areas to those of participants studying the L2 in a regular course in their home country, being L2 pronunciation one of the least researched areas and one yielding unclear results (Mora, 2008; Muñoz & Llanes, 2014; Stevens, 2011). Moreover, these studies have mainly focused on the immediate effects of learning context, and extremely few studies document the long-term effects of SA programs (Pérez-Vidal & Juan-Garau, 2009). Additionally, only one study includes children since the majority focus on college students (Llanes, 2012). The aim of the present study is to fill the gap in the SA and age literature by documenting the changes of the degree of foreign accent (FA) by a group of children before (pre-test) and after (post-test) the SA experience, and one year after their SA experience (delayed post-test).</p> <p>Eight Catalan/Spanish learners of English aged 11 years old engaged in a 2-month SA experience in Ireland, whereas six learned English (L2) in their home school. Participants were asked to narrate a story that consisted of six vignettes (Heaton, 1966) a week before and after their SA experience, and a year after their return. In order to keep content constant, the first 20 seconds of the story were selected and were randomly administered to a group of 11 judges who were native speakers of English. These judges rated the degree of perceived foreign accent on a 7-point Likert scale (1= strong foreign accent, 7= no foreign accent). Results show that SA participants significantly reduced their degree of foreign accent from the pre- to the post-test and from the pre-test to the delayed post-test results were marginally significant. However, AH participants did not experience any significant changes.</p> <p>Heaton, J. B. (1966). Composition through pictures. Essex, UK: Longman.Llanes, À. (2012).

<p>Driven by usage-based assumptions about language learning (Robinson & Ellis, 2008; Ellis & Cadierno, 2009), this study investigates the relative impact of a range of factors on the initial stage of EFL learning in young learners. Whereas the unquestioned belief is that an early start will necessarily favour young learners, not enough attention has been paid to contextual and linguistic factors that may explain the great diversity in foreign language outcomes that are commonly observed in large surveys, such as the European Survey of Language Competences (ESLC). Indeed in those surveys school pupils in countries with an early start can be observed to attain lower scores than school pupils in countries with an older starting age. Two of the factors that may explain such variability are exposure to the FL outside the classroom (Housen, 2012; Kuppens, 2010; Sundqvist, 2009) and language distance between the mother tongue and the target language (Lindgren & Muñoz, 2013; Van der Silk, 2010).</p> <p>On the basis of previous research findings showing the effects of out-of-school exposure to English before the start of English instruction (e.g., Lefever, 2010; Unsworth, 2014), the present study assumes that children from a country with considerable exposure to English and small linguistic distance between the first language and the target language will show a higher receptive knowledge of English at the beginning of school learning than children from a country with less exposure and larger linguistic distance. The study compares two samples of young learners of English, Danish and Spanish, respectively, divided into two groups of different age, 7 and 9 year-olds, as determined by the current start age policy in Denmark; the total number of participants is 200. Denmark and Spain differ in terms of exposure to English in society and at home, as well as in linguistic distance of the pupils' first language/s and English. On the other hand, children in Spain begin school English at an earlier age than children in Denmark. The instruments used to collect data include a parental questionnaire about the learners' frequency and type of out-of-school exposure, a receptive vocabulary test (the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test; PPVT-4; Dunn & Dunn, 2007), and a receptive grammar test (TROG, Bishop, 2003). Language distance is gauged by means of cognate linguistic distance measures (Dyen et al., 1992) which represent the percentage of the compared cognates that the languages share. These factors will be integrated into a complex multilevel analysis. Preliminary analyses show that the Danish learners have a greater advantage over the Spanish learners on (receptive) vocabulary than on (receptive) grammar, and that this advantage is larger for the older than for the younger starters. Results also give an indication of the number of additional hours needed by Spanish learners to match the Danish learners' outcomes. The presentation will discuss the results in light of the relative importance of contextual and linguistic factors and the implications in terms of comparative surveys and national language planning policies. </p>

<p>Morphological complexity (MC) is a relatively new construct in L2 studies. Most SLA research to date has focused on other aspects of complexity, namely lexical and syntactic complexity (for a review see Bulté and Housen 2012). The measure proposed here, called the Morphological Complexity Index (MCI) is based on a purely structural view of complexity, conceptualising a text's morphological complexity for a given word class as a function of the number and variety of different inflectional exponents found in that text (Pallotti 2015). More specifically, morphological complexity can be operationalized by randomly drawing sub-samples of N forms of a word class (e.g. verbs) from a text and computing the average within- and across-sample range of inflectional exponents. This produces a morphologically complexity index, which can be used to compare different texts.</p> <p> </p> <p>In this paper, we focus on morphological complexity as manifested in concrete L2 texts taken from the ICLE corpus (Granger et al. 2002) which were compared with similar texts produced by native speakers from the LOCNESS corpus (Granger. n. d.). Altogether 130 different texts (argumentative essays) were analysed, 90 coming from non-native speakers of Italian origin, 40 from the control group (native speakers of the British variety of English). The data was analyzed using a computer tool developed by the authors of this study that implements the operational definition of morphological complexity outlined above. In addition, different measures of lexical complexity - standardised TTR, Guiraud's Index and new-GSL coverage of basic vocabulary (Brezina & Gablasova 2013) - were computed. The L2 users' essays were also rated for accuracy and overall writing quality according to CEFR levels (Council of Europe, 2001) as well as for comprehensibility and coherence (Kuiken & Vedder 2014). These indices were used to assess the proficiency level of the learners' scripts.</p> <p> </p> <p>The results show that morphological complexity varies in the individual texts, but is not strongly related to proficiency of L2 users once the threshold (B1) level is reached. This result can be seen as complementary to De Clercq's (2014) finding that MCI tends to grow at lower proficiency levels.</p> <p>There was no statistically significant difference in MC between native and non-native users. Moreover, in the L2 group, there were only two statistically significant weak negative correlations between the new-GSL coverage and MCI for both verbs and nouns as well as one weak positive correlation between MCI for verbs and the general writing quality according to the CEFR descriptors. This shows that a larger vocabulary range and a more sophisticated writing style are somewhat positively correlated to morphological complexity. Nonetheless, all of these correlations explained only a small proportion of the overall variance in the data (R2 < 0.06). We can therefore claim that morphological complexity represents a fairly independent index that should be considered in combination with other complexity measures of L2 production such as lexical or syntactic complexity.</p>

<p>Dans la Recherche sur l'acquisition des langues, le développement de l'intérêt pour le plurilinguisme a naturellement placé les chercheurs devant une évidence (l'explosion du modèle binaire L1-L2) et a fait naître de nouvelles questions liées à la complexité des phénomènes d'influence, et notamment au rôle joué par les langues préalablement acquises.</p> <p>Depuis une décennie surtout, les études proposant des modèles de l'apprentissage des structures grammaticales se sont multipliées. Il existerait ainsi trois hypothèses concernant l'acquisition d'une grammaire L3 : soit a) il n'y a pas d'influence des langues sources, soit b) on constate une influence de la L1, soit c) on note l'influence de toutes les langues préalablement acquises.</p> <p>Dans le cadre de notre doctorat initié en septembre 2014, nous nous proposons d'étudier l'acquisition du français L3 et le rôle des langues sources (espagnol L1 et anglais L2) à travers l'analyse de transferts syntaxiques liés au groupe verbal. Nous nous intéressons plus particulièrement aux données recueillies auprès des étudiants de première année de la Filière de Traduction/Interprétation de l'Université de Concepción au Chili : ceux-ci commencent la filière avec un niveau débutant en français et un niveau A1-A2 en anglais et, comme ils suivent en parallèle un enseignement de langue de manière assez intensive (8 heures par semaine pour chaque langue), ils sont amenés à élever rapidement leur niveau de compétence.</p> <p>Notre corpus est constitué par des rédactions réalisées en condition d'examen de langue française, tout au long de l'année académique. Pour 2013, nous disposons de 12 rédactions différentes pour chacun des 12 étudiants sélectionnés ; pour 2014, nous avons 16 rédactions pour les 20 étudiants sélectionnés. Nous avons procédé à la description, au cas par cas, de la syntaxe des verbes afin d'identifier les possibles transferts et la langue exerçant son influence. Plusieurs aspects nous paraissent intéressants à analyser, comme la construction des compléments du verbe et leur éventuelle pronominalisation, la négation, l'absence ou le placement du sujet, etc. Ainsi, nous avons identifié trois phénomènes relatifs à la syntaxe du verbe : l'ordre des éléments dans le groupe verbal, la présence/absence d'un élément et la forme de ces éléments.</p> <p>Pour l'atelier des doctorants de EUROSLA 25, nous aimerions discuter deux difficultés de l'analyse des transferts : 1) leur identification irréfutable en tant que produit de l'influence d'une langue source ; 2) leur double aspect, négatif et positif. Il serait assez difficile en effet de distinguer ce qui, dans la progression de la L3, est imputable au transfert des connaissances préalables (rôle des langues sources) de ce qui est relatif à la construction de l'interlangue à partir de l'input en langue cible (processus développemental). Par ailleurs, les transferts positifs sont bien sûr beaucoup plus difficiles à repérer car une heureuse intuition linguistique ou le développement de l'interlangue peuvent être tout autant à l'origine d'une occurrence correcte. Cependant l'absence de preuve tangible et irréfutable n'est pas synonyme d'absence de transfert. Nous aimerions aborder ces deux points relatifs à l'origine de certaines réalisations syntaxiques en français L3.</p>

<p>Notre présentation vise à analyser quelques aspects du développement de l'espagnol L2 entre 5 et 11 ans chez des enfants de basque L1 provenant du Pays Basque espagnol.</p> <p>Au Pays Basque, l'espagnol étant L1 pour la plupart de la population, beaucoup d'effort a été fait pour la revitalisation du basque à travers des programmes d'immersion scolaire. Grâce à ces programmes, la perte de locuteurs du basque à été freinée et les jeunes sont en processus de devenir des locuteurs de basque L2. Les dernières enquêtes sociolinguistiques montrent les progrès faits dans ce domaine (Gouvernement Basque 2013).</p> <p>Néanmoins, il existe des zones au Pays Basque où la transmission intergénérationnelle du basque n'a pas été interrompue et où l'espagnol se considère L2 pour les enfants. Tel est le cas pour les 24 sujets de la présente recherche, provenant d'un environnement bascophone: la connaissance du basque atteint le 85% de la population, même si la présence sociale de l'espagnol n'est pas négligeable (Eustat, 2011, Soziolinguistika Klusterra, 2012). Ces enfants de familles bascophones, scolarisés en basque, bénéficient d'un enseignement de l'espagnol en tant que matière scolaire à partir de l'école primaire. Les études référents à l'acquisition de l'espagnol L2 chez des sujets bilingues basque-espagnol n'étant pas abondantes, des analyses sur des aspects spécifiques peuvent contribuer à une majeure connaissance de leur développement langagier.</p> <p>L'activité proposée consiste à restituer oralement un conte, sur la base d'un modèle produit préalablement par un adulte. La même activité se déroule à l'âge de 5, 8 et 11 ans. Les données d'un groupe d'enfants d'espagnol L1 qui réalise la même activité aux mêmes âges servent de contraste.</p> <p>En première lieu, nous analysons la capacité de produire, de manière autonome, des contes avec les éléments thématiques principaux. Nous montrerons un progrès clair, avec des résultats semblables à ceux de L1 espagnol.</p> <p>Deuxièmement, nous étudions les difficultés lexicales ou « lexical gaps » (De Houwer, 2009), ainsi que les incorporations des items lexicaux de la L1: des calques, des emprunts, des alternances codiques, définis comme des marques transcodiques dans le parler bilingue (de Pietro, 1988). Nous monterons une claire diminution de ces phénomènes de 5 à 8 ans et surtout de 8 à 11 ans.</p> <p>Finalement la production des formes verbales temporelles complexes sera analysée. L'inexistence des formes verbales comme le plus-que-parfait en basque semble produire des difficultés qui persistent encore à 11 ans chez les enfants d'espagnol L2.</p> <p>Nos résultats semblent indiquer que l'usage social de l'espagnol permet son apprentissage, malgré sa présence limitée en famille et à l'école. À l'exception de certains aspects spécifiques, les enfants d'espagnol L2 de la présente recherche développent cette langue de manière semblable aux enfants d'espagnol L1.</p> <p>Pour conclure, nous proposerons une réflexion autour des concepts de L1 et L2 en tenant compte des situations sociolinguistiques précises et sur les approches scolaires dérivées de ces concepts (Ortega et al., 2015).</p>

<p>While recognizing L1 transfer as a common phenomenon in L2 acquisition, an increasing number of L2 researchers have found evidence that L1 transfer is not inevitable. Yuan (2001) argues that L1 transfer is a relative, rather than absolute, phenomenon in L2 acquisition, but he does not specify in what way L1 transfer can be relativized. This paper is an attempt to fill in the gap by providing evidence from an empirical study of attitude-bearing wh-questions in English speakers' L2 Chinese. Following the analyses in Jakubowicz (2005, 2011) and Prévost et al. (2014), we will demonstrate that L1 transfer is relative to computational complexity and that computational complexity can override L1 transfer. Although English and Chinese wh-questions are different in that the wh-word in the former moves to the sentence initial position while that in the latter stays in situ, the two languages share some characteristics in their attitude-bearing wh-questions. In the literature, Chinese daodi...wh-questions are considered approximate counterparts of English wh-questions with phrases such as what the hell, who on earth. Like the hell in wh-the-hell questions in English, daodi in Chinese daodi...wh-questions can co-exist with a wh-adjunct such as weishenme “why”, the instrumental/manner zenme “how”, as well as a wh-nominal, such as shenme “what”, shei “who”. However, daodi cannot co-exist with the causal wh-word zenme “how come” in Chinese wh-questions. The unacceptability of this type of daodi...wh-questions is argued to be due to the fact that the wh-question bears two attitude features in it, an attitude feature of impatience borne by daodi and another attitude feature of counter-expectation carried by the causal wh-word zenme “how come”. This is similar to the unacceptability of how-come-the-hell question in English. Similar to the wh-the-hell-question in English, the wh-question in Chinese can accommodate daodi in it as long as the wh-word does not carry an attitude feature with it. Ninety-five English speakers and 18 native speakers of Chinese as controls participated in an acceptability judgment test. Neither positive L1 transfer nor negative L1 transfer is found in our study. That is, wh-movement in English wh-questions is not transferred into English speakers' L2 Chinese wh-questions, and the similarities between English and Chinese have very limited facilitating functions in English speakers' handling of Chinese attitude-bearing wh-questions. Based on Jakubowicz's (2005, 2011) formulation, we argue that less complex wh-questions are those Chinese ones with the wh-phrase in situ, and more complex ones are those English wh-questions which display overt wh-fronting (and subject-verb inversion). Although English speakers' L2 Chinese grammars are sensitive to attitude features, they are indeterminate in judging the Chinese wh-question with two attitudes in it. We argue that the bigger the number of possible attitude features embedded in the question, the more complex the computation is required and therefore, it is less likely for the L2 learner to make determinate judgment. In this sense, the possibility of L1 transfer in L2 acquisition is relative to and can be overridden by the linguistic complexity involved in the target language structure.</p>

<p>With the rise of self-regulation research not only in educational psychology (Boekaerts, 1999; Boekaets & Cacallar, 2006; Schunk & Zimmerman, 2008) but also in applied linguistics (Bown & White, 2010; Tseng, Dörnyei & Schmitt, 2006), the developmental process of self-regulation (including the social aspect of self-regulation) should be seen as an important aspect of the study of self-regulated language learning. However, empirical investigations focusing on the developmental process of self-regulated language learning are still scarce.</p> <p>The present study attempts to explore (1) the developmental process of learners' self-regulated language learning (i.e., what facilitates and impedes their self-regulation in foreign language learning) in the light of the theories of cyclical phases of self-regulation (Zimmermann, 1998) and self-regulatory subprocesses of naïve and skillful learners (Schunk & Zimmermann, 1998), and (2) the role of social context in its development (Hadwin & Järvelä, 2011; Schunk & Zimmerman, 1997). More specifically, it attempts to highlight critical points in the participants' previous foreign language learning experiences and perceptual changes in their own language learning through collaborative work.</p> <p>This paper reports on a multiple case study of two graduate students who took part in a hands-on workshop on self-regulated language learning. It is a descriptive, interpretative, and exploratory case study (Duff, 2014). Data were gathered through students work in the lecture and the focus group interview. Fourteen students who attended lectures on theories of self-regulation (including cycles of self-regulation and self-regulatory subprocesses), were asked: (1) to fill out a questionnaire on self-regulated language leaning; (2) to interview a partner about his or her self-regulated language learning; (3) to engage in group discussion about the partner's self-regulated language learning and about how to remove obstacles in the cycle of self-regulation; (4) to write a short report about their partner's self-regulation, indicating strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement; and (5) to write a report about their own self-regulated language learning. 12 out of 14 graduate students agreed to use their data for this research. Among them, two interviewees were selected from those who agreed to participate in the interview and from those who were willing, collectively, to undertake a deep observation of their partner's and their own self-regulated language learning. On the basis of the case study research method (Yin, 2009), the multiple data sources obtained (the focus-group interview and 1–5 above) were qualitatively analyzed using the theoretical propositions (i.e., cyclical phases of self-regulation and self-regulatory subprocesses of naïve and skillful learners).</p> <p>Qualitative analysis of multiple data sources revealed that through the hands-on workshop and the focus-group interview, the participants came to be able to monitor what was impeding their language learning and decide what they needed to do to make the flow of the self-regulation cycle smoother. The qualitative analysis also highlighted the reciprocal and cyclical relations between self-regulation and co-regulation, suggesting the need of the social aspect in explaining the cyclical phases of self-regulation. These findings are discussed with implications for teachers seeking to help promote better self-regulation in learners.</p>

Fluency in a dialogic task is inherently different from that in monologic task since it is affected by other factors such as the interlocutror's fluency and speaking skills and their willingness to communicate. Issues such as who should claim the between-turn pauses or how to account for the overlaps often add to the complexities involved in measuring fluency in a dialogue. This paper presents the findings of a study examining the development of fluency in both monologic and dialogic task performance of 35 learners studying EAP at a university in the UK. After discussing the complexities involved in defining and measuring the interactive aspects of a dialogue, the paper will present a comparative analysis of the similarities and differences between different aspects of fluency in monologic and dialogic task performance. While the results indicate that in the current study the L2 speakers consistently produced longer runs, shorter pauses, and faster articulation and speech rates in dialogues, with many of the measures statistically different from the monologues, the data analysis suggests that the operationalization of fluency measures may also affect the results. The paper will argue that a more clearly defined set of measures and a more systematic approach to measuring fluency in dialogic task performance is needed if a scientific approach to exploring L2 fluency is expected.</span></span></p>

<p>Several studies suggested that at an early age, bilingual children appear to be more sensitive to the phoneme structure of words and to the arbitrary nature of words than are monolinguals. The aim of the present study was to contribute to research on bilingual performance in the less examined domain of morphological awareness. Morphological awareness is considered as a kind of meta-linguistic awareness skill, which entails the ability to reflect on and manipulate morphemes, the smallest meaningful units in words (Kuo & Anderson, 2006). A growing body of research indicates a positive effect of morphological awareness on vocabulary knowledge, literacy acquisition, spelling, and reading comprehension. We predicted that morphological awareness can be applied cross-linguistically. This cross-linguistic influence might be in the form of acceleration of bilingual acquisition and might be related to typological proximity between the languages. The acceleration effect might be reflected in the emergence of late-acquired grammatical structures in one of the child's languages, if the other language's counterpart structure emerges earlier in acquisition (Paradis & Genesee, 1996). We investigated the accelerating effect of one Semitic language (Arabic) on another Semitic language (Hebrew) on the development of morphological awareness for specific domains, bound possessive and dual number forms of inflectional morphology. We expected that the earlier development of bound possessive and dual number forms in Spoken Arabic in comparison to Hebrew, together with the higher salience of these categories in Spoken Arabic, would have cross-linguistic influence and accelerate their acquisition by (L1) Hebrew-speaking children.</p> <p>A sample of 94 six-year-old children participated in the study. The bilinguals attended bilingual Hebrew-Arabic kindergartens and were divided into two groups, those with Hebrew as their home language (L1) and those with Arabic as L1. These groups were compared to monolingual Hebrew speakers and monolingual Arabic speakers. To assess the participants' morphological awareness skills, we used non-words that are similar in their structure to other familiar words in both target languages. The non-words represented six inflectional morphological categories which exist in both Arabic and Hebrew. We also compared the bilingual Arabic (L1) and Hebrew (L1) speaking children with their Arabic and Hebrew speaking monolingual peers, in each of the languages. We found that the bilinguals with Arabic as L1 and Hebrew as L1 performed significantly better than the Arabic speaking monolinguals and the Hebrew speaking monolinguals in the respective languages. The two bilingual groups did not differ from each other. We found also evidence for cross-linguistic influence of morphological awareness in Spoken Arabic on Hebrew in two categories: bound possessive and duality, which we believe is due to the higher saliency of these categories in spoken Arabic than in Hebrew. We assume that the context of bilingual education might also play a facilitating role and therefore contribute to the bilingual advantage.</p> <p>Kuo, L.-J., & Anderson, R. C. (2006).

<p>Traditionally idioms were seen as frozen multi-word units whose meaning could not be inferred from the individual meanings of the component words (e.g., Cruse, 1986; Katz, 1973; Moon, 1997). However, the supposed arbitrariness of meaning and non-compositionality of idiomatic phrases has been challenged by a number of studies in cognitive linguistics (e.g., Lakoff, 1987; Lakoff & Johnshon, 1980), which argued that a large number of idioms are semantically transparent because their meanings are motivated by different sets of conceptual metaphors that exist independently of the idiomatic expressions. This view of the semantic transparency of idiomatic expressions, however, has been disputed in the studies of Keyser and Bly (1999) and Keyser and Glucksberg (1993), which claimed that idioms are transparent because native speakers know their meanings, and use that knowledge to project relevant structures on compositional elements of the phrases. They observed that when idiom meanings were not familiar, native speakers' interpretation and their perceptions of idiom transparency were influenced by the context in which the idioms were presented, rather than by restrictions imposed by pre-existing conceptual structures. Keyser and Bly (1999) concluded that while idioms may instantiate conceptual metaphors, conceptual mappings per se do not contribute to the meaning of idiomatic expressions.</p> <p> </p> <p>The purpose of this study was to examine the possible constraining effect that knowledge of idiomatic meanings may have on perceptions of the semantic transparency of L2 idioms. A group of intermediate Japanese learners of English was asked to “guess” the meaning of 30 English idioms for which they had indicated no prior knowledge. The selected idioms had their semantic counterparts in Japanese, but their lexical make-up was different (e.g., apple polishing = goma suri (sesame grinding); love is blind = abata mo ekubo (pockmarks are dimples)). After the learners wrote their “definitions / translations” of the idioms, they were given a list of English–Japanese idiom equivalents, and asked to rate the transparency of the English phrases on a scale of 1 to 5. The target idioms were then taught over three 90-minute sessions with 10 idioms covered in each session. Idiom instruction consisted of verbal definitions and example sentences provided in L2, and a memory card game in which the learners had to match Japanese and English counterparts. One month after the last treatment session, the learners were given a recall test that consisted of 30 Japanese idioms for which they had to produce the English equivalents. After the test had been completed, the learners were asked to rate the semantic transparency of the English phrases once more. The results showed that a knowledge of idiom meaning affected the learners' perceptions of idiom transparency, but that transparency ratings had a limited effect on their ability to recall the target phrases. Data were also analyzed with regard to the strategies that learners used to make sense of unfamiliar idioms for which they had no contextual support. </p> <p> </p> <p></p>

<p>Vocabulary knowledge has been shown to be a good predictor of reading comprehension, if not the best one (Bernhardt &Kamil, 1995; Laufer, 1992; Nation 2001, 2006; Qian, 1999, 2002; Ulijn & Strother, 1990). Studies relating vocabulary size to reading achievement suggest that 6000-8000 word families cover 98% of a text's vocabulary and assure independent reading,whereas 4000-5000 cover 95% and enable minimally accepted reading comprehension with a dictionary or with teacher support (Hu & Nation, 2000; Laufer&Ravenhorst-Kalovski, 2010).</p> <p>Vocabulary size in such research has typically been measured by tests of meaning recognition. However, word comprehension during reading requires recall of words' meanings not choosing the meaning from various options. The present study investigates how reading comprehension is predicted by meaning-recognition vocabulary size tests and meaning-recall vocabulary size tests. This information is essential for establishing the validity of vocabulary tests for reading purposes, for setting vocabulary goals in reading courses, for researching the vocabulary-reading relationship and for a better understanding of vocabulary knowledge construct.</p> <p>The research questions were as follows:</p> <p>- How are the two vocabulary tests (meaning recognition and meaning recall) correlated with learners' reading scores?</p> <p>- How well does each test discriminate between learners' reading proficiency levels?</p> <p>- How accurate is each test's prediction of vocabulary size at each reading proficiency level when compared with corpus studies?</p> <p>In our study, reading was measured by a standardized national reading test and vocabulary knowledge – by two versions of a validated vocabulary size test: meaning recall and meaning recognition. Eighty eight college learners enrolled in English as a Foreign Language courses took the three tests. Based on their scores in the standardized national reading test, the students were divided into three proficiency levels. We correlated the reading scores with the two vocabulary scores, compared the three reading groups on each vocabulary test, and compared the vocabulary size ranges for each of the three reading proficiency groups with corpus studies.</p> <p>Both vocabulary scores (recall and recognition) correlated well with reading comprehension. All three reading proficiency groups were significantly different from one another in both vocabulary scores. Both size scores in the different reading proficiency groups corresponded to the sizes suggested by corpus studies (e.g. Nation, 2006), but the recognition scores were significantly higher than the recall scores in the entire learner sample and within each reading proficiency group. We conclude that both vocabulary scores are good predictors of reading comprehension and relate the results to test validity, lexical thresholds and vocabulary knowledge construct.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>

<p>Previous research has investigated the role of task-repetition in enhancing the fluency, accuracy and complexity of L2 learners' performance (e.g. Ahmadian, 2011; Bygate, 2001; de Jong & Perfetti, Lynch, 2001; Wang, 2014). Most of these studies, however, asked students to engage in the same task only once and the time interval between repetitions was often several days or weeks. Little is known about the role of immediate massed repetition and how such repetition contributes to the development of second language speech production processes across different types of tasks and for learners at different levels of proficiency. This study aims to fill these gaps and investigates the relationship between the repetition of oral monologue tasks and immediate gains in measures of second language fluency. It considers the effect of repetition on speech rate, frequency of filled pauses and self-repairs across different task types and proficiency levels in order to address the question of how many times EFL learners need to repeat tasks in order to optimize their linguistic encoding and monitoring processes within a time frame comparable to a typical lesson. 32 Japanese learners of English sampled at three levels of proficiency based on their TOEIC scores completed three oral communication tasks (instruction, narration, and opinion) six times each. The treatments were counterbalanced to control for performance effects and interlocutor proficiency.</p> <p> </p> <p>Results revealed that repetition was related to gains in oral fluency across proficiency levels and tasks. The gains in speech rate were the largest and most uniform across the first three repetitions of each task type, but participants continued to increase their speech rate through the fifth task repetition. Gains in speech rate began to level off after the third repetition and the pattern of development began to diverge across the three task types. There were no significant gains in speech rate between the fifth and sixth repetition of any of the tasks. A parallel trend could be observed in the case of the frequency of filled pauses, which continued to decrease in a statistically significant manner through the fourth repetition. Interestingly, statistically significant changes in self-repair behavior could only be observed after both speech rate and the frequency of pauses stabilized indicating the possibility of a conditional relationship between linguistic encoding and monitoring (Levelt, 1989; Kormos, 2006). The findings suggest that four repetitions might be necessary for learners to proceduralise their task-relevant linguistic formulation processes, and only after this can they devote more attentional resources to monitoring the accuracy of their performance. The presentation discusses the implications of these results for theories of second language use and development.</p>

<p>Cette étude porte sur l'expression de la temporalité dans des récits fictifs oraux produits par des apprenants ghanéens et polonais de l'italien L2 à Naples, où l'italien standard cohabite avec les variétés régionales et le dialecte. Nous focaliserons notre attention sur les formes verbales au passé, étant donné que les apprenants à Naples sont exposés à trois inputs productifs de la part des autochtones: l'Imparfait, le Passé Composé et le Passé Simple, ce dernier représentant une forme verbale qui a quasiment disparu dans le Nord de l'Italie.</p> <p>Nous essaierons de relever si les productions des apprenants sont contraintes par leurs L1s (Slobin,1996) quand ils doivent exprimer les relations temporelles en italien ou s'ils arrivent à reproduire le même système langagier que les italophones.

<p>First language (L1) is a critical factor that affects the acquisition of second language (L2) lexical competence. With the advancement of research from single lexeme to multiword units, studies that examine the L1 influence at the phrasal level have emerged. Some of them used phrasal decision tasks (PDT). The task is similar to well-established lexical decision tasks, where researchers show the participant an item (either a real word or a pseudoword) and ask whether it is a real word or not. In the PDT, researchers show either a felicitous or an infelicitous word combination, and prompt the participant to make a decision on each item. Depending on the nature of multiword units, however, difficulties arise in deciding the prompt. This problem is particularly pronounced when the target is collocations, which are looser word combinations than, for instance, idioms. Constituent words in collocations can co-occur naturally with many other words (e.g., small child, small bed, little child), and seemingly unnatural collocations can make sense given a specific context (e.g., a happy potato in fiction where a potato is a character). This flexibility contributes to the creativity of language, but makes it difficult to call infelicitous collocations incorrect or unreal. This study aimed to examine whether the L1 influence on the acquisition of L2 collocations observed through the PDT is affected by prompts. Three prompting words were tested: acceptable, commonly used, and natural. An English PDT was created by involving the congruent (L1=L2) and incongruent collocations both in existing (i.e., found in the BNC and COCA) collocations (Yes-items) and in non-existing collocations (No-items). The PDT was given to L1-Japanese university students (JS) and native speakers of English (NS), both of whom were residing in Japan at the time of testing. The JS additionally supplied their confidence rating on each item. Data were analysed with mixed effects modelling containing participant and item random intercepts and participant random slope. In addition to Prompt and Congruency (the primary interest of this study), Collocation Frequency, MI Scores, and Confidence were included in the analysis where applicable. In Yes-items, following effects were observed: Prompt and Collocation Frequency in both groups; Congruency, MI Scores, and Confidence in the JS. In No-items, significant effects were Congruency in both groups, Prompt in the NS, and Confidence in the JS. The observed effects of Prompt indicated that both groups of participants tended to affirm items when acceptable was in the prompt, leading to higher accuracies in Yes-items and lower accuracies in No-items than the other two prompting words. Despite this, however, the L1-L2 congruency effect was clearly observed in the JS. Therefore, the overall result suggests that, although prompts do have effects pointing to the importance of careful selection of the prompt, the L1 influence is recognizable through the PDT with different prompts (at least with those tested in this study). Interestingly, the NS also showed the congruency effect in No-items, implying the cross-linguistic influence from their L2 to L1. Further implications from the findings will be discussed in the presentation.</p>

<p>We present a study in linguistics and psycholinguistics using a functionalist approach to the study of production of verbs by adults learning French as a second language. We investigate the production of semantic approximations such as ouvrir un fruit (‘to open a fruit') for the action of peeling an orange that are also sometimes classified as metaphors or errors of overextension. Previous research has suggested that it is important to draw attention to lexical-semantic relations of verbs in second language acquisition in adults' speech, noting that there has been insufficient research in this. Viberg (2002) considered overextensions as errors and argued that learners of a second language produce many overextensions at earlier stages of acquisition. Although it has been hypothesized that this kind of error disappears at an advanced level and conventional usages may decrease as learners advance, evidence has not been collected from samples large enough to confirm this hypothesis. The objective of this paper is to investigate production of semantic approximations at different levels in French second language acquisition.</p> <p>We used Duvignau and Gaume's (2004) APPROX protocol which contains 17 actions that are broadly similar to the 61 actions tested in Bohnemeyer, Bowerman and Brown's (2001) protocol that has been widely used. Duvignau and Gaume's protocol includes actions from the general domains to damage, to separate and to take away and includes actions of ‘cutting', ‘breaking', ‘peeling', ‘pulling apart', etc. This paper presents results from a verb denomination task in a hundred and twelve adult learners of French at different levels (A – beginner, B - intermediate and C - advanced) and in thirteen native speakers.</p> <p>Main results show that the learners produce semantic approximations at every level. Learners at more advanced levels produce more conventional verbs but the hypothesis that they will use less semantic approximations only receives mitigated support. Our expectation that the use of conventional expressions reflects knowledge of appropriate specific or support verbs is confirmed. Finally most semantic approximations are produced with generic verbs. To sum up, our study produces some limited support for the hypothesis that the palliative strategy helps learners to resolve a problem of lack of conventional verbs and in consequence produce semantic approximations.</p> <p><strong>References</strong></p> <p>Bohnemeyer, J., Bowerman, M. and Brown, P.

<p>Liaison is a phenomenon of external sandhi that involves the production of a latent coda consonant (liaison consonant, LC) in prevocalic contexts (e.g. [z] in des [de] + ânes [an] → des ânes [dezan], (some) donkeys, but not in des [de] + poules [pul] → des poules [depul], (some) hens. The segmental content of the LC is thus dependent on the first word but produced as the onset of the second word: [de.zan]. As a consequence, word and syllable boundaries do not align. It has been argued that this misalignment constitutes potentially different difficulties for L1 and L2 learners (Wauquier, 2009).</p> <p>In the early stages of L1 acquisition children typically misinterpret the LC as the lexical onset of word2, leading them to substitute the LC and to produce sequences such as [ɛ̃zan] instead of un âne [ɛ̃nan] (a donkey) (Wauquier & Shoemaker, 2013). These errors are unattested in adult L2 learners. Indeed although LC substitutions are present in adult L2 learners' productions, they can typically be attributed to the written form of the word ([ɡʁɑ̃daʁbʁ] for grand arbre [ɡʁɑ̃taʁbʁ]) (Thomas, 2004). At the same time L2 learners produce LCs without resyllabification (e.g. [dez.an] instead of [de.zan]), an error that has not been reported in monolingual acquisition. These errors have also been interpreted as being influenced by the written form.</p> <p>However, to date, the vast majority of previous studies have focused on monolingual preliterate children or highly literate adult L2 learners with primarily written exposure to French. To bridge the gap between these two populations, we propose in this study a qualitative analysis of L2 learners without systematic written input.</p> <p>This presentation brings together data from two beginning groups of French: preliterate children (n = 3, L1: Swedish, age of onset of acquisition: 3;0-3;5) and adults who have had little to no formal instruction in French (n = 10, L1: Chinese and Bengali). All learners received predominantly oral input without systematic written support. Productions of un/deux+noun (cases of obligatory liaison) were elicited using a picture-naming task.</p> <p>Results from both groups include productions previously reported for L2 learners (e.g. LC without resyllabification).

<p>Current research on L2 sentence processing finds that syntactic structure building in a late-learnt L2 is associated with greater difficulty than in native sentence comprehension (for overview, see Roberts, 2013). Models of L2 processing tie these difficulties either to age-related changes in syntactic representations (Clahsen & Felser, 2006), proceduralized grammatical knowledge (Ullman, 2005), attenuation in the integration of morphosyntactic knowledge in real-time comprehension (Jiang, 2007) or they relate them to lower levels of efficiency in lexical processing that subserves parsing (e.g. Dekydtspotter, Schwartz & Sprouse, 2006; Dekydtspotter & Renaud, 2014; Hopp, 2014; Miller, 2014).</p> <p>This paper directly investigates whether and how lexical processing difficulty contributes to difficulties in L2 syntactic processing. In a self-paced reading experiment with 36 monolingual and 62 L1 German advanced speakers of English, we investigate (a) whether slower lexical processing in the L2 affects syntactic structure building and (b) whether differences in lexical processing between L1 and L2 readers can give rise to differences between non-native and native parsing. Following on previous research on native processing (Tily, Fedorenko & Gibson, 2010), we test how the on-line L2 comprehension of English subject and object clefts, which differ in syntactic complexity, is moderated by differences in lexical access, as manipulated by frequency differences of the main clause verb ({high-frequency/low-frequency}, see (1)).</p> <p>(1) a. It was Amandai who ti {scared/horrified} Sulena with a frightening look. (subject cleft)</p> <p> b. It was Amandai who Sulena {scared/horrified} ti with a frightening look. (object cleft)</p> <p>Linear mixed-model regression analyses with the factors Cleft Type and Verb Frequency show that lexical processing systematically affects L2 syntactic processing, with linear delays of syntactic structure building as verb frequency decreases in L2 processing. For high-frequency verbs, L2 readers show reading slowdowns between subject and object clefts in the cleft region, whereas, for low-frequency verbs, these slowdowns surface in the following post-cleft region. A regression model using verb frequency as a continuous variable shows that native processing is not affected by differences in lexical processing in the same frequency range as L2 processing; however, comparable effects of verb frequency on structure building surface for much lower frequency verbs in native comprehension.</p> <p>The main finding that L2 readers show larger frequency effects than natives supports current models of the bilingual lexicon such as the Weaker Links hypothesis, which argue that lexical representations are less stable and accessible in L2 than in native processing (Gollan, Montoya, Cera & Sandoval, 2008). Critically, these effects implicate differences in syntactic structure building between natives and non-natives in that they attenuate and delay effects of structure building in L2 sentence processing. Such lexical and syntactic interactions are compatible with capacity models of L2 processing (e.g. McDonald, 2006; Hopp, 2010), which suggest that native and non-native syntactic processing are fundamentally isomorphic, yet differ in resource allocation. In the talk, we discuss implications for current models of L2 sentence processing.</p>

<p>Although it is widely accepted that attention plays a key role in second language development, it is only recently that eye-tracking methodologies can provide a detailed insight into second language (L2) learners' attentional processing. The aims of the study reported in this presentation were to investigate how students pay attention to target items in written L2 input in different input conditions, how the learners' knowledge of a target syntactic construction changes in these conditions and how the change under different conditions is related to attentional processing. We investigated these questions in an eye-tracking study conducted with 100 undergraduate L2 learners of English in Sri Lanka. The students were divided into five groups of 20, with one control group and four other groups receiving different types of input. The experimental groups participated in an input session for three consecutive days. In each session the participants read a story containing 7 examples of the grammatical construction ‘causative had'. The first group read the stories with no textual enhancement (unenhanced only) and the second with the examples of the target structure visually enhanced (enhanced only). The third group was exposed to enhanced input with a specific instruction that asked them to pay attention to the highlighted construction in the input (enhanced+ instructions). The fourth group only differed from the third one in that they received explicit explanation of the target construction between the first and second exposures (enhanced+ instruction+ explanation). The control group received no treatment. Improvement on the knowledge of the target construction was measured by comparing post-test and pre-test scores on a sentence reconstruction (SR) and grammaticality judgement (GJ) task. Eye tracking was used to collect data on attentional processing. Total fixation duration (TFD) and the difference between observed and expected total fixation duration (DTFD) were considered as measures of the attention paid to the examples of the target construction. </p> <p>The unenhanced only and enhanced only groups demonstrated a random pattern of TFD and DTFD, while the enhanced +instructions and enhanced+ instructions+ explanation groups showed a high TFD and DTFD at the beginning of the exposure which then gradually decreased. The MANOVA analysis revealed a statistically significant increase in the gain score of the SR items in the enhanced+ instructions and enhanced+ instructions+ explanation groups compared to the control and the unenhanced only groups. TFD and DTFD showed a significant correlation with the gain scores on the SR and GJ tasks in the enhanced+ instructions+ explanation group. A significant correlation between DTFD and gain scores in the enhanced+ instructions and enhanced only groups was also found. The results suggest that unenhanced input is not effective in directing learners' attention to the target structure and results in no change in learners' knowledge. Although visual enhancement can lead to increased attention to the target features, it was not found to contribute to improved performance in the post-test. The findings indicate that either specific instruction to pay attention to target features in the input or explicit explanation is needed for measurable gains in knowledge. </p>

<p>This presentation focuses on individual differences in the Emotion Recognition Ability (ERA) of 920 participants (687 females, 233 males). The sample consisted of 356 first (L1) and 564 foreign language (LX) users of English from all over the world. Recognising emotions can be particularly challenging in LX contexts (Pavlenko 2005, author a, b). Depending on their linguistic and cultural profile, individuals may interpret the input very differently, and LX learners and users have been found to perform significantly worse than native control groups (Rintell 1984). Part of the difficulty in recognising emotion in an LX is that fact that people from different cultures focus more on certain cues and may struggle when they are absent or less obvious (Tombs et al 2014).</p> <p>We investigate the effect of three independent variables, namely L1 versus LX status, proficiency in the LX, and cultural background on ERA. <br />We used an online survey, where participants had to identify a basic emotion portrayed by a native English-speaking actress in six one-minute-long audiovisual clips. She improvised situations in which she expressed happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise and disgust. Just as in real life, ERA depends on verbal, vocal and visual cues: in some videos the verbal channel was the most informative one, in others the vocal and/or visual cues were more prominent.<br />Participants also filled out the LexTALE, a 60-item lexical test developed by Lemhöfer and Broersma (2012) to gauge their English proficiency.</p> <p>Against expectations, no significant difference emerged between English L1 users and LX users' ERA scores. For the LX sample, a significant positive relationship was found between lexical test scores and ERA. A significant effect of L1 culture was found on ERA scores, with Asian LX users scoring significantly lower than European and North-American LX users, possibly because of differences in affective socialization in East and West (Pavlenko 2014).</p> <p>The most original finding of the present study is thus that audiovisual input allows (advanced) LX users to recognize emotions in an LX as well as L1 users. That said, LX proficiency and L1 culture do have an effect on ERA.</p> <p><strong>References</strong></p> <p>Lemhöfer, K., & Broersma, M. (2012).

<p>Vocabulary knowledge is recognized as one essential element for second language acquisition and reading comprehension (for example Laufer 2009). One known method to encourage and support vocabulary development amongst second language learners is keeping a vocabulary notebook (Schmitt & Schmitt, 1995). Vocabulary notebooks aid in the “noticing” of, and attention to, new lexical items -- essential components of vocabulary development (Schmitt 2008). They also allow students, under their teachers' guidance, to explore their own learning strategies and to choose which strategies are more suitable and useful for them. This exploration might contribute to the development of the learners' metacognitive skills, leading to enhanced independent learning (Anderson, 2002; Hudson 2007).</p> <p>This study is based on the use of vocabulary notebooks amongst 3rd- year student teachers participating in a Vocabulary Acquisition and Teaching course. The primary purpose of the study was to document three aspects of the student teachers' own development: (1) linguistic (expansion of their own vocabulary), (2) metacognitive (understanding of the best strategies for them, raising awareness to their own vocabulary development), and (3) pedagogical (internalization of the method and their readiness/will to use vocabulary notebooks in class, empathy towards their own students and comprehension of the learning processes in view of their successes and failures in vocabulary acquisition). The study also examines the impact of the use of vocabulary notebooks by student teachers of ESL in their process of internalizing the use of this learning and teaching tool.</p> <p>Participants are fifteen 3rd-year students in an English teaching program in a teachers' college. English is a foreign language (not second language) for the participants, so English input and output are limited. Consequently, subjects provide both a view into advanced learners' use of vocabulary notebooks and a teacher's perspective of its use. A mixed methodology was implemented. For the qualitative part three tools were be used: 1) an examination and analysis of the student teachers' vocabulary notebooks; 2) an analysis of the participants reflections on their use of vocabulary notebooks as learners and as student teachers; and 3) in-depth interviews with participants. For quantitative measurements of vocabulary acquisition a personal vocabulary test was devised for each participant, based on her own vocabulary notebook. This test measured the acquisition of target words and effectiveness of the vocabulary notebook strategy.</p> <p>Results indicate that student teachers at first had difficulty in implementing vocabulary notebooks as learners. Constant modeling was necessary for internalization of the method but through repeated use and instruction many participants increasingly developed their skills and interest in using notebooks as a vocabulary teaching and learning tool. Some development of their metacognitive skills was also documented: Through guidance, entries increasingly developed from simple translation to more sophisticated and in-depth use of vocabulary notebooks.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Object clitic production by Russian–Cypriot Greek Bilingual Children</strong></p> <p>This study investigates linguistic development of bilingual children in Cyprus, specifically with respect to object clitic production. 23 Russian–CG simultaneous bilingual children took part in the study. All of them born in Cyprus, in a mixed-marriage family (Cypriot father and Russian mother); 11 boys and 12 girls, aged from 3;1 to 8;4. Developmental Verbal IQ Test (Stavrakaki and Tsimpli, 2000) together with the background questionnaire were used in order to get the information of children's language proficiency in Greek and their linguistic and socio-economic background. Greek oral production data, obtained via elicited story-telling (Tsimpli et al., 2005), was recorded, transcribed and analysed in terms of object clitic (non)target production/omission and relevant features such as gender, case, number and person.</p> <p>Given that Russian has no clitics, if Russian–CG bilinguals transfer from L1 Russian, they can omit object clitics in obligatory contexts, and because of the characteristics of the (un)interpretable features, 3rd person clitics can be omitted more often than 1st and 2nd person clitics, as the latter have interpretable animate features (Tsimpli and Dimitrakopoulou, 2007).</p> <p>Overall, bilingual children produced 9,664 words. The analysis of the data showed that bilingual Russian–CG children produced 306/43.4% overt object clitics, 328/46.5% overt object DPs, 13/1.8% overt object pronouns, while the rate of the object clitic omission was low (58/8.2%). They could misanalyse the clitics as weak pronouns and omit them because of the influence of L1 transfer from Russian or tend to use nouns instead of object clitics to express old/given discourse information (McShane, 2005; Erteschik-Shir et al., 2013). The analysis of the data showed that in root clauses bilingual children prefer to use pre-verbal (172/64.1%) rather than post-verbal object clitics (26/76.4%).</p> <p>It was found that bilingual Russian CG children omitted only 3rd person object clitics, mainly of neuter gender (35/60.3%). As for overt object clitics, they were of 1st (26/9.7%), 2nd (12/4.4%) and 3rd (230/85.8%) person, mainly of neuter (132/51.1%) and masculine (89/34.4%) gender. The main problem in agreement (between object clitic and its antecedent) was gender, they used neuter instead of masculine (13/32.5%) and feminine instead of neuter (20/5%), mainly due to L1 interference. This can be the evidence in support of the Interpretability Hypothesis (Tsimpli and Dimitrakopoulou, 2007).</p> <p>The same children were tested on elicitation object clitic production task (within a because-clause island), Clitic-in-Islands tool, developed in Action A33 (Varlokosta et al., to appear), adapted to CG. It elicited more overt object clitics (86%) and fewer instances of DPs (8.3%) or object clitic omissions (4.1%) than the story-telling task. For elicitation task it was found that bilingual children lag behind their monolingual CG peers with respect to object clitic production; for the story-telling task, they performed better than their mothers, who were tested on the same tool and produced more DPs (81%) than overt object clitics (14%) or object clitic omissions (3.5%). The linguistic development of bilingual children depends on the quantity and quality of input and their linguistic environment.</p>

<p>The present study investigates inter-individual variation in the frequency of flow experiences in the Foreign Language Classroom. A total of 1740 current FL learners from around the world provided feedback via an on-line questionnaire (1287 females, 449 males, mean age: 24). Flow is the mental state of operation when people perform an activity in which they are so fully immersed and involved, with such focus and enjoyment, that they forget everything around them. When members of a group reach a state of flow they experience spontaneous joy and it strengthens bonds with other group members. It is described as the ultimate experience in harnessing the emotions in the service of performing and learning (Csikszentmihalyi 1990). The questionnaire contained 4 items asking participants what percentage of classroom time they were in a state of positive flow (losing sense of time, being absorbed, fulfilled and happy) and 4 items reflecting negative flow (being distracted, frustrated, paralysed, unengaged). A final open question asked about experiences of Foreign Language Enjoyment (FLE) and flow in the FL classroom.</p> <p>Statistical analyses revealed that FLE had a small but significant effect on positive flow, but no effect on negative flow. Surprisingly, foreign language classroom anxiety (FLCA) boosted positive flow episodes at low levels of FLE, but hindered positive flow at intermediate and advanced levels of FLE. In other words, FL learners who did not enjoy FL classes got “in the zone” thanks to FLCA, but FLCA was a drag for those who enjoyed their FL learning. Both FLE and FLCA had a small but significant effect on negative flow. A higher degree of multilingualism, high FL mastery, high relative standing in the group, higher education level, older age group, females and North and South American participants scored higher on percentage of time in positive flow. The same variables were inversely linked to percentage of time in negative flow. Statistical patterns are complemented by participants' observations of flow states in the FL classroom.

<p>Tasks have been widely used in second language acquisition research as relevant tools to explore language learning opportunities available to second/foreign language (L2/FL) learners (García Mayo, 2007; Samuda and Bygate, 2008). Some of that research has focused on the effects of task repetition on learners' oral production and has shown the benefits of this task implementation variable for subsequent L2 learning (Bygate, 2001; Kim Tracy-Ventura, 2013 – but see Kim, 2013 for a different view), Research on task-repetition has mainly focused on adult and adolescent populations but research with young learners is scarce, and more so in EFL settings (Pinter 2007; Shintani, 2012, 2014) where exposure to the target language is limited to the classroom. Children in EFL contexts are a relevant group to consider as most European countries have mandated an early exposure to the foreign language and teachers should be informed about valuable pedagogical tools. Two recent students (Bret Blasco, 2014; Sample and Michel, 2014) have focused on the impact of task repetition on young learners' oral complexity, accuracy and fluency (CAF). They have reported a significant increase of fluency through task repetition but mixed findings regarding complexity and accuracy, which were probably due to the small sample of participants.</p> <p>Our study analyses the effects of task repetition on the oral production of child EFL learners in Spain. Specifically it focuses on the potential effects task-repetition might have on CAF. The participants (n=120) were 27 dyads in 3rd grade (8-9 years old) and 33 in 4th grade (9-10 years old) and had a beginner proficiency level as established by official tests for their age range. They had been exposed to English since they were 4 and received 5 hours of class per week. At Time 1 (T1) all the children completed a spot-the-difference (STD) task in pairs. At Time 2 (T2) task repetition and task familiarity were controlled for: 11 dyads in 3rd grade and 10 dyads in 4th grade completed exactly the same task (task repetition condition: same procedure, same content); 5 dyads in 3rd grade and 11 dyads 4th grade took a STD task with a different content (procedural repetition: same procedure, different content); the control group, 11 dyads in the 3rd year and 12 dyads in the 4th year completed a guessing game task. All the oral interactions were transcribed verbatim using CHILDES and each utterance was codified for CAF.</p> <p>Our findings only showed significant differences between T1 and T2 regarding increased fluency in the 3rd year procedural repetition group (z = -2.803, p = .005) at T2. There is a mixed picture concerning trade-off effects between complexity and fluency. However, other positive aspects of task repetition can be reported such as increased confidence and cooperation between the members of the pairs. Both quantitative and qualitative data will be presented together with implications for foreign language pedagogy and lines for further research.</p>

<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Willingness to Communicate (WTC) in an L2, which is widely believed to facilitate the acquisition of the target language, has recently been extensively investigated (Gallagher, 2013; MacIntyre, Burns, & Jessome, 2011; Cao, 2011). WTC is assumed to generate a driving force within learners to look for opportunities for communication in the target language; therefore, higher WTC is generally associated with higher L2 use (MacIntyre et al, 1998), though it has not been empirically tested. In Dörnyei and Kormo's (2000) study, authors found no significant correlations between L2 oral performance and either L1 WTC or any social variables among 46 Hungarian students. Although having drawn much positive attention, it is currently unclear whether self-reported L2 WTC is a significant predictor of actual classroom L2 communication. This presentation reports on an attempt to fill this gap by investigating to what degree learners' self-reported L2 WTC predicts actual L2 use in the classroom. </span></span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;">A group of 372 Japanese university EFL learners majoring in science and liberal arts subjects participated in the study. Students' oral performance data were collected three times during the group discussions in one academic semester. The number of words each student produced during each discussion was counted. Based on the results of previous WTC studies (MacIntyre et al., 1998; Yashima et al., 2004) and Dörnyei's (2005; 2009) Motivational Self System, a hypothesized structural model was constructed integrating four variables; motivation, ideal L2 self, self-reported L2 WTC, and observed L2 use, and tested with structural equation modeling. </span></span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The results suggested that self-reported L2 WTC predicted actual L2 use (β = .68), suggesting that overall, students' willingness to communicate was manifested in actual L2 communication with their peers in the classroom. Communicative tasks are effective in enhancing communicative skills, only if learners actively engage in interactional tasks and produce a certain amount of L2 output, ideally, in proportion to their WTC. In this sense, the result of this study that self-reported L2 WTC predicted actual L2 use in the classroom is of significance. Pedagogical implications of the research findings and implications for language sciences will be discussed. </span></span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;"> </span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;">Dörnyei, Z.

Whereas some consider L1 and L2 transfer to be developmentally constrained, others claim that L1 and/or L2 transfer shape the L3 initial state (e.g., Bardel & Falk, 2007, Flynn, Foley, & Vinnitskaya, 2004; Håkansson, Pienemann & Sayehli, 2002; Rothman, 2011). A factor that is often considered to promote L1 and L2 transfer is psychotypology: the learner's perception of source and target language distance (Kellerman, 1977). However, even though participants' perceptions are often assumed to be pivotal, they are actually seldom measured. Instead, it is implicitly or explicitly presupposed that psychotypological estimates are identical with the conclusions of linguistic typology. The current study aimed at overcoming this limitation by assessing psychotypological estimates with a multi-item questionnaire. Its results were related to those from an elicited imitation task and spontaneous production. The study examined the acquisition of L3 German by native speakers of Swedish with English as their L2. The similarities and differences among these three languages enabled the exploration of the different transfer hypotheses. A developmental perspective was taken by testing participants of different proficiencies quasi-longitudinally on syntactic structures representing developmental stages of L2/L3 German. The results of the elicited imitation task and the spontaneous production suggested that learners follow general developmental trajectories for syntax. These trajectories did not seem to be susceptible to modification by typological similarity between the participants' L1 or L2 and their target L3. Furthermore, results suggested that whether participants perceived German and Swedish as being more or less similar did not affect their German L3. In sum, there were no indications that developmental trajectories were modified by structural similarities between L1 or L2 and L3, regardless of whether such similarities were perceived or established on objective grounds.</p>

<p>An important strand of research in the field of Task-Based Language Teaching (TBLT) has aimed to better understand the variables of task-design which render different tasks more or less effective in facilitating L2 acquisition (e.g., Pica et al.1993). The current study aimed to investigate an as-yet little-studied dimension of information exchange, the phenomenon of framing, and its effect on negotiation for meaning (NfM). “Framing” derives from Goffman's (1974) notion of activity frames, the idea that any stretch of human activity is organized by certain rules and principles to which people “fit their actions” (including, crucially, their language). In conversation, the metacommunicative process by which individuals signal what they are doing by speaking is called “framing”.</p> <p>In the current study, eight pairs of students, simultaneously involved in two different role plays, were recorded during a regularly scheduled “English Through Conflict Resolution” class in an American university's intensive English summer program. Four pairs performed the first role-play, as mediators to a conflict, while the other four pairs performed the second role play, as parties in the same conflict. It was hypothesized that the parties would demonstrate a higher level of engagement with more instances of NfM (measured by counting instances of confirmation and comprehension checks, and clarification requests), than the mediators, due to the more invested nature of their role in the dispute. Analyses of transcripts showed that no differences obtain when using traditional measures of NfM. However, a closer textual analysis revealed that framing one's contributions as adversarial (parties) or collaborative (mediators) had a marked impact on 1. the amount and quality of assistance learners provided each other in conversation, with mediators providing more co-constructions, other-corrections and continuers (Foster & Ohta, 2005), and 2. the type of questions produced, with parties asking substantially more content questions, maintaining a highly argumentative dialogue.</p>

<p>The positive effect of a supportive written context on comprehension and retention when faced with a previously unknown idiomatic expression is today an indisputable fact, especially if relevant clues are given in close proximity of the item in question (Nation 2001). Research has also shown that giving learners a chance of visualizing the meaning of an idiom by offering them its source domain and/or by elaborating etymologically, i.e. providing a mental picture in addition to the spoken/written form (referred to as dual coding), seems to enhance comprehension and retention even further, especially if the idiom is of a more transparent kind (Boers, Demecheleer & Eyckmans 2004). For example, by explaining that walk the plank has a maritime origin and a canary in a coal mine comes from the time when canaries were kept in cages to warn miners if gas was leaking out at which point the canaries succumbed immediately, learners' comprehension and retention have been shown to increase.</p> <p>The present study aims to investigate whether contextualization of an audiovisual kind could help increase comprehension and retention of not only comparatively transparent items, such as wear one's heart on one's sleeve, but of more opaque ones too, e.g. mum's the word. 40 Swedish first-term university students studying English as part of their education to become middle-school teachers participated in the investigation, which tested 24 idioms, all of which were ascertained to be previously unknown to the informants. While half of the learners were subjected to a test in which they were asked to watch scenes from various TV programmes, each scene including one idiomatic expression in a supportive context, the remaining 20 students, as a point of reference, were only offered written contexts, though equally supportive. Immediately after these sessions, both groups were given the same idioms in a decontextualized form (but in a different order) and asked to give their meaning. After five weeks, finally, the students were subjected to yet another decontextualized comprehension test (the same items but again in a different order). In both post-tests, the informants were also asked to evaluate their comprehension and retention.</p> <p>Since research has shown that mastery of idioms in one's L1 correlates to a great extent with a person's ability to comprehend idioms in an L2 (Karlsson 2012), all the informants were also asked to take a test focusing on idioms (of varying transparency, but with approximately the same total frequency as the L2 idioms) in their L1. The result on this test is thus seen to indicate each student's potential for understanding and memorizing various idiomatic expressions from a more general perspective.</p> <p>Preliminary results clearly show that audiovisual contextualization indeed has a positive effect on learners' retention of not only transparent items but also of those that are quite diffuse in character. In addition, preliminary results also show that those learners' who were able to recall most meanings were those who had a propensity for idiom comprehension in their L1.</p> <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;"> </span></p>

<p>L2 research has witnessed a boom in the number of studies that investigate learners' use of multi-word combinations with the help of measures of association strength such as the mutual information (MI) score (e.g. Durrant & Schmitt, 2009; Li & Schmitt, 2010; Granger & Bestgen, 2014). Most studies so far, however, have investigated positional co-occurrences, where words are said to co-occur when they appear within a certain distance from each other (Evert, 2004), and focused more particularly on adjacent word combinations such as adjective + noun combinations.</p> <p>Paquot (2014) is to the best of our knowledge the first study that adopted a relational model of co-occurrences, where the co-occurring words appear in a specific structural relation, to compare three learner sub-corpora made up of texts rated at different CEFR levels (i.e. B2, C1 and C2). She made use of the Stanford CoreNLP suite of tools to parse learner data and extract dependency relations such as dobj(win,lottery), i.e. “the direct object of win is lottery”, and then used MI score computed on the basis of a large reference corpus to analyse pairs of words in specific grammatical relations. Findings showed that adjective + noun relations discriminated well between B2 and C2 levels; adverbial modifiers separated out B2 texts from the C1 and C2 texts; and verb + direct object relations set C2 texts apart from B2 and C1 texts. These results suggest that, used together, phraseological indices computed on the basis of relational dependencies are able to gauge language proficiency.</p> <p>The main objective of this study is to investigate whether relational co-occurrences also constitute valid indices of phraseological development. To do so, we replicate the method used in Paquot (2014) on data from the Longitudinal Database of Learner English (LONGDALE, Meunier 2013). In the LONGDALE project, the same students are followed over a period of at least three years and data collections are typically organized once per year. The 78 argumentative essays selected for this study were written by 39 French learners of English in Year 1 and Year 3 of their studies at the University of Louvain. Unlike in Year 2, students were requested to write on the same topic in Year 1 and Year 3, which allows us to control for topic, a variable that has been shown to considerably influence learners' use of word combinations (e.g. Cortes, 2004).</p> <p>Relational co-occurrences are operationalized in the form of word combinations used in four grammatical relations, i.e. adjective + noun, adverb + adjective, adverb + verb and verb + direct object. We assign to each pair of words in the LONGDALE corpus its MI score computed on the basis of the British National Corpus, and compute mean MI scores for each dependency relations in each learner text. To explore the links between individual and group phraseological development trajectories, a detailed variability analysis using the method of individual profiling and visualization techniques will also be presented (cf. Verspoor & Smiskova, 2012).</p>

<p>This paper aims at shedding light on the learnability and representation of the depictive (Samuel wiped the clean table) and the resultative construction (Samuel wiped the table clean) by Brazilian Portuguese-English bilinguals. Both constructions are licensed and productive in English. In Brazilian Portuguese (BP), dissimilarly, the same syntactic pattern of the resultative construction (Samuel esfregou a mesa limpa) is unlicensed with a resultative reading, but it is fully grammatical and productive with a depictive reading. Thus, the resultative construction poses a challenge for Portuguese-English bilinguals, as not only must they learn a syntax-semantics mapping unlicensed in their L1, but they must also inhibit the L1 reading of the same structure. Furthermore, the depictive and the resultative construction have different rules concerning the AP licensing (Samuel wiped the table dirty*/Samuel wiped the dirty table). Therefore, bilinguals also have to acquire event structure constraints that govern the construction in the L2. In the present study we tested how bilinguals in different levels of proficiency represented both the depictive and the resultative construction in the L2 in comparison to the native speakers of this language. An acceptability judgment test with the magnitude estimation was run and yielded the results summarized in TABLE 1.</p> <p>TABLE 1: Means of acceptability judgments for the depictive, grammatical resultative and ungrammatical resultative constructions.</p> <p>The main results indicate that lower proficiency bilinguals (LPB) did not differentiate the grammatical and the ungrammatical resultative construction (Z=-.039, p<.969). Also, the LPB presented a lower acceptability judgment for the grammatical resultative construction in comparison to the high proficient bilinguals (HPB) (Z=-.5132, p<.001) and the native speakers (NS) (Z=-.5751, p<.001). These results may indicate that LPB have not fully learned the grammatical resultative construction and have not learned this construction's constraints. Surprisingly, the same behavior was found in regards to the depictive construction, for which LPB also had a lower acceptability in comparison to the HPB (Z=-.3573, p<.001) and the NS (Z=-3.562, p<.001). The HPB behaved similarly to the NS in relation to the acceptability of the depictive construction (Z=-.455, p<.649) and of the grammatical resultative construction (=Z-1.513, p<.130). The HPB also differentiated the grammatical and the ungrammatical resultative construction (Z=-4.443, p<.001) as the native speakers did (Z=-9.658, p<.001). However, the HPB presented a considerably higher acceptability for the ungrammatical resultative construction in comparison to the NS (Z=-7.994, p<.001). These results suggest that BP-English bilinguals can learn the resultative construction as much as they can learn the depictive construction, but they are not as sensitive to the constraints of the resultative construction as the native speakers are. These data are interpreted as evidence for the multi-competence construct, which predicts L1 influence in the representation of the L2 mainly in lower levels of proficiency, and the superset subset construct that suggests that constraints in the L2 are difficult for bilinguals to learn.</p> <p> </p>

<p>This paper compares the use of Spanish Unaccusative Constructions with se (UC-SE), such as <strong>se</strong> quemó la casa ‘the house burned' in native (NS) and non-native speakers (NNS) of Spanish. Previous work has shown that judgments of UC-SE can be similar among NSs and NNSs (Montrul, 2004; Toth, 2006), but NNSs face difficulties with recognizing the specific pragmatic and discursive conditions that constrain the use of the construction (Hertel, 2003; Lozano, 2006; Zyzik, 2006). By examining syntactic optionality in unaccusativity at the syntax-discourse interface, this paper investigates whether NNSs choose UC-SE when faced with natural discursive situations shaped by communicative effectiveness, narrative flow, and information focus. Crucially, these more naturalistic situations have not been directly addressed in previous research, which is an important gap filled by the present study.</p> <p> </p> <p>The current study consists of two tasks. Firstly, using a production task, spontaneous oral narrations of accidental events were collected from a group of 45 NNSs who were American advanced learners of Spanish and 45 NSs who were monolingual Spanish speakers. Syntactic choices in the main verb-event/state of each narration were measured and compared, as well as the total number of UC-SE used in the production task. Secondly, an acceptability judgment task was carried out to address possible metalinguistic knowledge and compare the task's results with those from the production task.</p> <p> </p> <p>The results of the study showed that NSs use significantly more UC-SE (X̄=2.71, s=2, sum=122) than NNSs did (X̄=1.11, s=1.2, sum=50) in the production task, p = .001, 95% CI = [.921, 2.295]. The contrast between the results from the production task and those from the acceptability judgment task indicates differential behaviors of NSs and NNSs in both tasks. In the acceptability task, NNSs showed a significantly greater acceptability of UC-SE over sentences without SE, however they used UC-SE less often than NSs did in the production task. NSs, on the other hand, showed no significant preference for UC-SE over sentences without SE in the acceptability judgment task (t(88) = -5.95, p < .001, d=1.5), but they used UC-SE categorically in the production task.</p> <p> </p> <p>These findings suggest that different cognitive systems are deployed in the completion of each task, which is consistent with Sorace and Serratrice's (2009) claim that acceptability judgment tasks mainly address metalinguistic awareness, without indication of the unconscious usage of L2 knowledge. Similarly, the paper gives evidence for the Syntactic Optionality Theory (Sorace, 2000, 2014). In both speaker groups, there are different competing syntactic options with divergence in the strength and tolerance of the available options, as predicted by Sorace (2000, 2014). Overall, findings of this paper indicate that the syntactic choices of both NSs and NNSs are tied to the discursive activity. Namely, such choices are not only a matter of grammaticality but also the selections that best express the speaker's perspective of the narrative, their discursive preferences, and the association of information at the syntax-discourse interface. The paper provides naturalistic evidence of such discursive activity, in addition to insights about grammatical preference.</p>

<p>En didactique des langues, la recherche sur l'acquisition du vocabulaire a apporté au cours des 20 dernières années de nombreuses clarifications à propos des enjeux, des difficultés et de l'importance de l'enseignement et de l'apprentissage du vocabulaire (Nation, 2001). Cependant, le débat autour de certaines questions empiriques telles que les mérites de la lecture et de l'enseignement explicite ou implicite, est loin d'être terminé. Plusieurs études ont montré les effets que la lecture extensive peut avoir sur le développement du vocabulaire (Pigada et Schmitt, 2006; Nation, 2001). Ces mêmes travaux reconnaissent que l'acquisition incidente (sans effort délibéré de la part de l'apprenant) à travers la lecture est un processus lent et propice aux erreurs conduisant à un gain limité du vocabulaire (Laufer, 2005). Cependant, Hustijn (2011) estime que ce gain pourrait être renforcé par des activités favorisant un traitement détaillé des relations forme-sens, une fois la lecture effectuée. Mais, que peut faire l'enseignant pour favoriser le traitement approfondi du vocabulaire? Un enseignement explicite centré sur la forme (FFI) (enseignement qui attire l'attention des apprenants sur les propriétés formelles de la langue cible) pourrait représenter une solution avantageuse. Cependant, cette hypothèse n'a pas été largement testée et validée. L'objectif de cette étude est de combler ce vide empirique et d'étudier les effets de différentes approches sur l'apprentissage du vocabulaire.</p> <p>Vingt-trois apprenants du français langue seconde dans trois classes ont participé à cette étude. L'intervention expérimentale (quatre périodes de 45 minutes chacune) visant 36 mots ciblés dans quatre textes a été réalisée à travers trois conditions expérimentales (l'enseignement intégré, l'enseignement isolé, la répétition) et une condition de contrôle (l'apprentissage incident à travers la lecture). Tous les participants bénéficient des quatre types d'approche. Un certain nombre de mots est enseigné de façon isolée avant le début de la lecture de texte. Un certain nombre est enseigné de façon intégrée pendant la lecture de texte et chaque fois qu'un mot destiné à cette condition est rencontré. Le vocabulaire destiné à la condition de répétition n'est pas enseigné. Au lieu de cela, le mot est répété trois fois dans le texte et pour ce faire, les textes sont légèrement manipulés. Et finalement, le vocabulaire destiné à la condition d'apprentissage incident n'est ni répété ni enseigné. Des tests réceptifs et productifs du vocabulaire cible ont été administrés une semaine avant, une semaine après et deux semaines après l'intervention. Les résultats indiquent les avantages significatifs du FFI en comparaison avec l'apprentissage incident et la répétition. Cependant, aucune différence n'a été observée entre le FFI isolé et le FFI intégré. Les résultats et leurs implications pédagogiques sont également discutés.</p>

<p>In a number of previous studies it was found that timing patterns develop in the curse of second language acquisition. In particular, it has been detected that speech rhythm (defined as durational variability of certain speech constituents) and speech tempo (defined as syllables per second) change with proficiency growth in L2. Ordin, Polyanskaya and Ulbrich (2011), Ordin and Polyanskaya (2014), Ordin and Polyanskaya (under review) and Ordin, Polyanskaya and Wagner (2015) clearly demonstrated that L2 speech tempo and variability in duration of syllables, vowel sequences and consonantal clusters increase as L2 acquisition progresses. Advanced speakers deliver speech at a faster rate and exhibit more stress-timed patterns in L2 English compared to elementary and intermediate learners. This trend has been confirmed in L2 English produced both by L2 learners with syllable-timed native language (French) and with stress-timed native language (German). Comparison with rhythmic patterns of native English speakers showed that only advanced German learners of English delivered speech with the degree of stress-timing and at the rate characteristic of speech delivered by native English speakers. German learners at elementary and intermediate levels and French learners at all proficiency levels produced English utterances with more syllable-timed rhythm and at a slower speech rate. However, it is a known fact that not all deviations from the native patterns are perceptually relevant and contribute to the degree of perceived foreign accent in L2 speech. In our study, we wanted to concentrate on the contribution of non-native timing patterns into accentedness.</p> <p>To estimate the relative contribution of speech tempo and speech rhythm into perceived foreign accent, we selected 15 English sentences, each produced by German and French learners at elementary, intermediate and advanced levels. Then we used a speech synthesis technique to create the versions of each sentence that differed only in rhythm, only in tempo, or only in speech and tempo: sounds and intonation patterns were taken from native English speakers. Rhythmic and tempo patterns in resynthesized stimuli imitated rhythm and tempo of German and French learners of English at different proficiency levels. Then we asked native English listeners to evaluate the accentedness in the original and resynthesized sentences on a 6-point scale. The results are presented in Figures 1-2.</p> <p>We found that deviations from the native norms in both speech rate and speech rhythm are perceptually relevant and contribute to the degree of perceived foreign accent. The effect of speech rate and speech rhythm on accentedness depends on the native language of the learner. If native and target languages of the learner are rhythmically contrastive, then rhythm makes a bigger contribution into the degree of perceived foreign accent than tempo. If native and target languages of the learner are rhythmically similar, then tempo makes a bigger contribution into the degree of perceived foreign accent than rhythm, and the effect of rhythm on accent rating will be smaller compared to the effect of rhythm if the native and target languages are rhythmically contrastive.</p>

<p>Input enhancement is argued to be a promising endeavor to direct language learners' otherwise elusive attention to a form in question, and thus to facilitate its acquisition (Schmidt, 1993, 2001). In light of the potential pedagogical benefits of input enhancement, research on input enhancement has burgeoned in the past two decades. However, in the extant literature, a discrepancy in the results regarding the effect of input enhancement has appeared (Lee & Huang, 2008). The inconsistent results could in part be attributed to a divergence in methodological features and in part to the probability that the effect of input enhancement is susceptible to a number of mediating factors (Lee & Huang, 2008). The abundance of input enhancement research notwithstanding, it is still not clear as to how, or to what extent, the factors mediate the its effects. Accordingly, more research on input enhancement is needed. The present study pursued this line of research by means of an investigation into the effect of visual input enhancement vis-à-vis target structures.</p> <p>The current study employed a pretest-posttest-delayed posttest design to investigate the effect of visual input enhancement on the learning of two Chinese homophonous structural particles 的 and 得. The study involved 59 participants (19 male, 40 female; aged between 17 and 47) who were learning Chinese as a second language. The students were divided into three groups—an enhanced input group (N= 21), an unenhanced input group (N = 21), and a comparison group (N = 17). Ten target-feature-embedded written texts were created and used for 10 treatment sessions spread through 10 days. The enhanced and unenhanced input groups received the same texts, with one exception. The target features of the texts given to the enhanced input group were supplemented via the combined use of circling and underlining. The comparison group did not receive treatment. Two tests were used as the pretest, posttest, and delayed posttest to assess the learners' knowledge of the target features. A mixed-design repeated-measure ANOVA was performed to explore the effects of the treatment. Results showed that both enhanced and unenhanced input facilitated learning of the target features. However, the enhanced group outperformed the unenhanced group. In terms of the effects of input treatment on the learning of the two homophonous Chinese structural particles, enhanced input facilitated learning of 得, but not 的. Unenhanced input did not have a differential impact on the learning of the two target features. </p>

<p>Private speech (PS) is one of a few areas within second language acquisition that attracts great attention from both social psychologists (see John-Steiner 1985 1992, John-Steiner & Mahn 1996, Wertsch 1988) and applied linguists (see Lantolf 2000, Lantolf & Appel 1994) which are all inspired by the original work of Vygotsky (1931/1997). Among areas within the Vygotskian framework, PS is particularly of interest to applied linguists because it shows not only how second language speakers make new language features comprehensible, and process and internalize them, but also how they do this, mentally, by themselves.</p> <p>Since Krashen's influential work on input in 1982, many SLA researchers have focused on the ways in which new language features are made comprehensible, the role of co-participants, and the possible connection between comprehension and acquisition when L2 learners either work in pair-work or group-work activities (Pica 1985, Long 1985, Ellis 1990, Varonis & Gass 1985). While these social activities provide communicative contexts in which L2 learners interact with co-participants and solve language-related problems resulting in language learning, less is known about the possibility of PS in providing comprehensible input. This study explores the connection between PS and comprehensible input and the process through which EFL students go during PS. Of particular interest is how the students talk themselves during PS, through a conversation analytic (CA) lens.</p> <p>Since 1990, CA has become a research tool which allows researchers to study classroom interaction, due to the belief that social interaction provides the main source of input. However, little attention has been paid to PS, another possible source of input, from a CA perspective. As PS involves sounds that one verbalizes and which are therefore observable, there are data CA-motivated researchers can analyze to show how PS leads to language learning. This study, inspired by a CA perspective, explores 1) the verbal and 2) interactional features of PS by ten EFL learners during two sessions of two-hour grammar and reading comprehension tasks with a high level of complexity.</p> <p>The EFL students' PS is recorded and then transcribed, while the focus is on 3) the pattern and 4) the direction of PS. An analysis of the data shows that a) several features of spoken language such as repetition, paraphrasing, incomplete syntactic structures, are found, b) keywords that are believed by the EFL students to provide or lead to the answer are verbalized, c) an adjacency-pair during PS is not always complete (meaning that one of the two parts is sometimes missing), but it is accompanied by the features presented in a), d) PS are used by EFL learners mainly to disagree and negotiate with themselves more than to agree with themselves, e) EFL learners use PS for refreshing memory, finding themselves alternative solutions and answers, and putting problems/questions together with solutions/answers, f) PS found in this study is similar to a narrative, and g) PS helps EFL students solve language-related problems. Further studies are needed to show the connection between PS, long-term memory, and SLA.</p>
